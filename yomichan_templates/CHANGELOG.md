# Yomichan Templates Changelog
The versioning differs from the card template version:
it simply refers to the year/month/date
of the changes.
Versioning only starts at v23.01.16.0 since that was the first version when
I started explicitly recording the changes.


## v23.01.19.0
#### Fixed
- Fixed a minor bug where the "ãƒ»" regex replace for the NHK dictionary was not working as expected with the newline span wrapper

## v23.01.16.0
#### Features
- Added support for `ignored-freq-dict-regex` to ignore arbitrary frequency dictionaries

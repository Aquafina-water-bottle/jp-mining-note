What Is Pitch Accent? \u00b6 Here is a (slightly modified) excerpt taken from the AJT Japanese Github page that explains the notation well: Quote For more information on the Japanese pitch accent, I would like to refer you to this wikipedia article . In short, the following notations can be found: Overline : Indicates \"High\" pitch (see \"Binary pitch\" in Wikipedia article). Overline downstep : usually means stressing the mora/syllable before. Red circle mark : Nasal pronunciation. For example, \u3052 would be a nasal \u3051, and would represented as \u3051 \u00b0 . Blue color : Devoiced mora (barely pronounced at all). For example, \u30d2 would be closer to h than hi. Likewise, \u30af would be more like a k than ku. Specifying Pitch Accent \u00b6 The displayed pitch accent is usually the first position found in PAPositions . However, you can override this automatically chosen position using the PAOverride field. The demo above covers the most basic usage of PAOverride , which should suffice for most people. The rest of the page covers the details on exactly how PAOverride works, and all the ways to customize how the pitch accent is displayed. Colored Pitch Accent \u00b6 The reading, word and pitch overline can be automatically colored in Migaku style colors, according to the pitch accent. This automatic coloring behavior is disabled by default , and must be enabled in the runtime options : Enabling colored pitch accent (click here) \"auto-pitch-accent\" : { \"enabled\" : true , // (1)! \"colored-pitch-accent\" : { \"enabled\" : true , // ... } // ... } The auto-pitch-accent module must be enabled to use colored pitch accent. Note The \u8d77\u4f0f pattern is not automatically detected. To use this color, you must manually set the PAOverride field to -1 . Pitch Accent Groups \u00b6 Anki Tag \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e Example Reading heiban \u5e73\u677f \u81ea\u7136 \u3057\u305c\u3093\uffe3 atamadaka \u982d\u9ad8 \u4eba\u751f \u3058\uff3c\u3093\u305b\u3044 nakadaka \u4e2d\u9ad8 \u5f31\u70b9 \u3058\u3083\u304f\u3066\uff3c\u3093 odaka \u5c3e\u9ad8 \u9053\u5177 \u3069\u3046\u3050\uff3c kifuku \u8d77\u4f0f \u9a5a\u304f \u304a\u3069\u308d\uff3c\u304f When Pitch Is Not Automatically Colored \u00b6 Pitch accent coloring requires a numeric position value somewhere within the card. This is usually found in one of two places: PAPositions PAOverride Usually, PAPositions is automatically filled. In the cases where pitch accent coloring does not work as expected, your two main options are: Using PAOverride with a number (recommended). Force the pitch accent group with tags (see below). Override Pitch Accent Group \u00b6 In some extremely rare cases, you must set manually set the pitch accent group, if the available options do not work. To do this, add the appropriate tag to the card. The exact tags that can be used are shown in the summary table above, under the Anki Tag and \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e sections. For example, the tag can be heiban , \u5e73\u677f , etc. Note The tag only overrides the pitch accent color, and does not affect the pitch accent representation itself. This fact can be useful for certain exceptions, such as how \u901a\u308b is [1] instead of [2]. If you want to use the \u8d77\u4f0f pattern on \u901a\u308b, you will have to set the PAOverride value to 1 , and then add the \u8d77\u4f0f tag. TODO image of above (without tag, with tag) How Pitch Accent is Selected \u00b6 Pitch accent is selected based on the following priority: PAOverrideText PAOverride PAPositions AJTWordPitch The first field that is non-empty will be the field that is used to display the pitch accent. Note When the auto-pitch-accent module is disabled, the priority changes to the following: PAOverrideText PAOverride AJTWordPitch Of course, as the module is disabled, PAOverride will not be parsed in any way. More info on this can be found in the PAOverride field section below. (1) PAOverrideText \u00b6 New in version 0.11.0.0 (latest version: 0.11.0.4 ) If the PAOverrideText field is filled, then this field is displayed exactly as is, without any changes or parsing. This provides the most flexibility, but the least ease of usage. PAOverrideText with: \"Hello world!\" (2) PAOverride \u00b6 The PAOverride allows for two primary formats: positions and text format. If the field contents cannot be parsed in either of these formats, then the field is displayed without any special formatting. This will act just like PAOverrideText . (2.1) PAOverride: Positions Format \u00b6 When the PAOverride field contains any number, that number will be considered as the downstep position, and be rendered as such. The number -1 represents the \u8d77\u4f0f pattern, and can be used to set the downstep to be after the second last mora. Examples (on the \u507d\u8005 card): PAOverride Result Notes 0 \u30cb \u30bb\u30e2\u30ce 1 \u30cb \ua71c \u30bb\u30e2\u30ce -1 \u30cb \u30bb\u30e2 \ua71c \u30ce \u8d77\u4f0f Multiple Numbers \u00b6 New in version 0.11.0.0 (latest version: 0.11.0.4 ) Multiple numbers can be used, as long as they are separated by commas. This is useful on certain words with devoiced mora, where the pitch accent can be multiple positions with little real distinction. Additionally, individual numbers can be bolded to grey out the other positions. This is useful to highlight the correct pitch accent among all possiblities. Examples (on the \u507d\u8005 card): PAOverride Result Notes 0,2,4 \u30cb \u30bb\u30e2\u30ce \u30fb\u30cb \u30bb \ua71c \u30e2\u30ce\u30fb\u30cb \u30bb\u30e2\u30ce \ua71c 0 ,2, 4 \u30cb \u30bb\u30e2\u30ce \u30fb\u30cb \u30bb \ua71c \u30e2\u30ce\u30fb\u30cb \u30bb\u30e2\u30ce \ua71c The parser ignores all whitespace. <b>0</b>,2,4 \u30cb \u30bb\u30e2\u30ce \u30fb \u30cb \u30bb \ua71c \u30e2\u30ce \u30fb \u30cb \u30bb\u30e2\u30ce \ua71c Restrictions on bolded numbers Multiple numbers cannot be bolded together. If you want to bold multiple numbers, they have to be bolded individually. Additionally, commas cannot be bolded. For example, 0,<b>1</b>,<b>2</b>,3 is valid, but 0,<b>1,2</b>,3 and 0,<b>1,</b>2,3 are invalid. (2.2) PAOverride: Text Format \u00b6 New in version 0.11.0.0 (latest version: 0.11.0.4 ) How To Type Special Characters (click here) This section requires you to type certain special characters. You can type these characters on any standard IME. Characters Result \\ \uff3c \u3046\u3048 ( ue ) \uffe3 , \u3001 / \u30fb If no number is found within the PAOverride field, the contents will be parsed using this format. To define any pitch accent in text format, use \u300c\uff3c\u300d to specify downstep. For example, \u4eba\u751f should be written as \u300c\u3058\uff3c\u3093\u305b\u3044\u300d. For words with no downstep (\u5e73\u677f\u578b), the \u300c\uffe3\u300d character must be placed at the end of the word. For example, \u8eab\u9577 should be written as \u300c\u3057\u3093\u3061\u3087\u3046\uffe3\u300d. Removing the required \uffe3 symbol (click here) The restriction that \u5e73\u677f words require the \uffe3 symbol at the end can be removed using the following runtime option : { \"modules\" : { \"auto-pitch-accent\" : { \"pa-override\" : { // set to false (default: true) \"heiban-marker-required\" : false , } } } } This would allow any words without any downstep marker to be rendered as \u5e73\u677f. Using the above example, one can instead type \u8eab\u9577 as \u300c\u3057\u3093\u3061\u3087\u3046\u300d. Examples : PAOverride Result \u3058\uff3c\u3093\u305b\u3044 \u30b8 \ua71c \u30f3\u30bb\u30a4 \u3044\u304d\u304a\uff3c\u3044 \u30a4 \u30ad\u30aa \ua71c \u30a4 \u3069\u3046\u3050\uff3c \u30c9 \u30a6\u30b0 \ua71c \u3057\u3093\u3061\u3087\u3046\uffe3 \u30b7 \u30f3\u30c1\u30e7\u30a6 Multiple Words \u00b6 Multiple words can be defined, as long as they are separated with either the \u300c\u30fb\u300d or \u300c\u3001\u300d characters. This is particularly useful on expressions with multiple words, such as \u300c\u6bd2\u3092\u98df\u3089\u308f\u3070\u76bf\u307e\u3067\u300d. Examples : PAOverride Result \u3069\u304f\uff3c\u3001\u304f\u3089\u3046\uffe3\u3001\u3055\u3089\uffe3 \u30c9 \u30af \ua71c \u3001\u30af \u30e9\u30a6 \u3001\u30b5 \u30e9 \u3061\uff3c\u304b\u30fb\u3061\u304b\uff3c \u30c1 \ua71c \u30ab\u30fb\u30c1 \u30ab \ua71c Note This renderer will not accept any field with formatting. This means that bold, italics, overlines, etc. cannot be present in the field. For example, the input <b>\u306b\u305b\u3082\u306e</b> will be rejected. (2.3) PAOverride: Raw Text \u00b6 As a last case resort, if the input of this field cannot be parsed as either of the two, the exact contents of PAOverride will be displayed. This will behave exactly the same as PAOverrideText . (3) PAPositions \u00b6 This field is automatically filled out as long as Yomichan has pitch accent dictionaries, and the tested word is covered in said dictionary. By default, the first pitch of the first dictionary is shown. Show All Possibilities in Dictionary \u00b6 New in version 0.11.0.0 (latest version: 0.11.0.4 ) Sometimes, pitch accent dictionaries show multiple pitch accents for a word. However, only the first pitch accent is shown by default. One entry (default) All entries One entry + bold All entries + bold If you want to show all of the pitch accent entries (in the first dictionary), use the following runtime option : { \"modules\" : { \"auto-pitch-accent\" : { \"pa-positions\" : { // default: true \"display-entire-dictionary\" : false } } } } If you want to select the correct pitch accent, bold that position in PAPositions (or simply use PAOverride as described above ) Note This option only works on cards formatted with JPMN's {jpmn-pitch-accent-positions} marker. This means this option will not work on old cards that were imported to the JPMN format. (4) AJTWordPitch \u00b6 If you have the optional AJT Pitch Accent add-on installed and correctly configured, then this field is automatically generated on all cards. This is used as a fallback option, in case your installed pitch accent dictionaries does not cover the tested content, but this add-on does. How the Reading is Selected \u00b6 The reading consists of the actual kana that is shown on the card. By default, the word reading is selected based on the following priority: AJTWordPitch WordReading Reading: AJTWordPitch \u00b6 Usually, the reading is selected from AJTWordPitch . This has a few features over the raw word reading: AJTWordPitch usually includes devoiced and nasal info, whereas WordReading does not. Readings are katakana, and cannot be changed to hiragana. Note If you do not want the reading in AJTWordPitch to be used, change the following runtime option to false : { \"modules\" : { \"auto-pitch-accent\" : { // set to false (default: true) \"search-for-ajt-word\" : false , } } } Reading: WordReading \u00b6 If the word cannot be found under AJTWordPitch , then the default reading in WordReading is used, and displayed in katakana. Unlike AJTWordPitch , this reading can be changed to hiragana, katakana, or katakana with long vowel marks in the runtime options : { \"modules\" : { \"auto-pitch-accent\" : { // 0: whatever is shown in WordReading (usually hiragana, but can sometimes be katakana) // 1: force katakana // 2: force katakana with long vowel marks \"reading-display-mode\" : 1 , } } } Pitch Accent Styling Details \u00b6 This covers some details if you are directly using PAOverrideText , and want to have a similar format to the generated pitch accent. You very likely won't be doing this. The generated style is exactly the generated style of the AJTWordPitch field. To display the style properly, copy and edit the HTML tags directly. If you want to grey out other words, you will have to use the bold <b> tag. However, you must wrap the greyed out words with the <b> tag. This is the opposite of what would expect from everything in this page, but the behavior is this way due to restrictions in the current CSS specification. Example with all possible styles: \u30c1\u30e5 < span style = \"text-decoration:overline;\" class = \"pitchoverline\" > \u30fc\u30ab < span class = \"nasal\" > \u00b0 </ span ></ span >< span class = \"downstep\" >< span class = \"downstep-inner\" > \ua71c </ span ></ span >< span class = \"nopron\" > \u30af </ span > \u30bb\u30a4 < b > \u30fb\u30c1\u30e5 < span style = \"text-decoration:overline;\" class = \"pitchoverline\" > \u30fc\u30ab < span class = \"nasal\" > \u00b0 </ span >< span class = \"nopron\" > \u30af </ span ></ span >< span class = \"downstep\" >< span class = \"downstep-inner\" > \ua71c </ span ></ span > \u30bb\u30a4 </ b >","title":"Pitch Accent"},{"location":"autopa/#what-is-pitch-accent","text":"Here is a (slightly modified) excerpt taken from the AJT Japanese Github page that explains the notation well: Quote For more information on the Japanese pitch accent, I would like to refer you to this wikipedia article . In short, the following notations can be found: Overline : Indicates \"High\" pitch (see \"Binary pitch\" in Wikipedia article). Overline downstep : usually means stressing the mora/syllable before. Red circle mark : Nasal pronunciation. For example, \u3052 would be a nasal \u3051, and would represented as \u3051 \u00b0 . Blue color : Devoiced mora (barely pronounced at all).

Although I was originally fine with this, I started to realize some issues with only having these two card types: Vocab cards that require context have to be turned into sentence cards, and Sentence cards take a very long time to review, and can create context-based memories. I found that many vocab cards had to be turned into sentence cards, since either the context was fundamental to understanding the definition, or there were other parts of the sentence that I wanted to test. This lead to many sentence cards, which naturally meant that Anki sessions lasted longer. I attempted to tackle these exact issues by introducing new card types outside of the fundamental vocab and sentence cards. Vocab Card \u00b6 A vocab card simply shows the target word at the front. You test yourself on the reading and definition of the word. How to create: This is the default card type. Nothing has to be done for the card to be a vocab card. Sentence Card \u00b6 A sentence card simply shows the entire sentence at the front. You test yourself on the reading and meaning of the entire sentence. How to create: Fill the IsSentenceCard field. Targeted Sentence Card (TSC) \u00b6 A targeted sentence card is a special case of the sentence card. The sentence is shown at the front, but only the highlighted content (only the word by default) is tested. This allows you to have all the information and context of the sentence, but you don't have to waste your time testing other parts of the sentence. This card type was originally defined here . How to create: Fill the IsTargetedSentenceCard field. Hint Cards \u00b6 Hint cards are a group of card types that display the sentence below the word. This acts as a better alternative compared to manually adding the sentence in the Hint (or HintNotHidden ) field. Hint Vocab Card \u00b6 Warning New as of version 0.12.0.0 . This version is currently bleeding edge , so this feature cannot be used unless you compile the templates from the dev branch. TODO img A hint vocab card is simply a vocab card that shows the sentence below the word. The tested content is the word itself, so you would test yourself as if it were a TSC or Hover Vocab card . How to create: Fill the IsHintCard field. Hint Vocab Card (highlighted) \u00b6 Warning New as of version 0.12.0.0 . This version is currently bleeding edge , so this feature cannot be used unless you compile the templates from the dev branch. TODO img This is exactly the same as the Hint Vocab Card, except the word within the sentence is automatically highlighted. This is tested the exact same as the Hint Vocab Card. How to create: Fill the IsHintCard and IsTargetedSentenceCard fields. Hint Sentence Card \u00b6 Warning New as of version 0.12.0.0 . This version is currently bleeding edge , so this feature cannot be used unless you compile the templates from the dev branch. TODO img A hint sentence card is very similar to a Hint Vocab card, except the tested content is the entire sentence. This is indicated by the fact that the word is colored. This is tested exactly like a Hover Sentence Card . How to create: Fill the IsHintCard and IsSentenceCard fields. Hint TSC Card \u00b6 TODO img Similarily to the normal TSC, this can be used to only test yourself on a specific portion of the sentence. This is tested exactly like a Hover TSC . How to create: Fill the IsHintCard , IsSentenceCard and IsTargetedSentenceCard fields. Note For all other card types, only IsTargetedSentenceCard has to be filled to create a TSC. However, for hint cards, both IsSentenceCard and IsTargetedSentenceCard must be filled out. Hybrid Cards \u00b6 Hybrid cards are a group of card types that attempt to combine the power of sentence cards and vocab cards into one. They all have the distinct feature that the word is shown at the front, while the sentence is hidden but can be shown through some natural means. Additionally, all hybrid cards have some form of underline beneath the tested word, to differentiate it between a vocab card. The primary reason why this exists is to prevent context-based memories. For example, in a TSC or sentence card, you may only remember the tested word due to its surrounding context. Notes For all forms of hybrid cards, you can press n to toggle whether the sentence is shown or not. The \"How to test\" sections are simply recommended ways of testing, and are by no means the required way of testing yourself. Feel free to test yourself differently depending on whatever you think works the best. Hover Vocab Card \u00b6 A hover vocab word shows the tested word at the front. When you hover over the word, you can see the full sentence, with the tested word highlighted. This acts similarly to a vocab card. However, you are given the option to see the full sentence without failing the card. This is also known as the fallback card . Indicator: Grey & dotted underline under the word. How to test: Attempt to guess the reading and definition of the word without hovering over the word. If you are able to guess both the reading and definition of the word, flip the card. Otherwise, hover over the word and guess the reading and definition of the word with the entire sentence. How to create: Fill the IsHoverCard field. Click Vocab Card \u00b6 A click vocab word shows the tested word at the front. When you click on the word, you can see the full sentence, with the tested word highlighted. This card acts as an intermediary between the hover vocab card and the vocab card itself. You must guess the reading BEFORE revealing the sentence, but you can use the sentence to guess the definition. Indicator: Grey & dashed underline under the word. How to test: Attempt to guess the reading of the word without hovering over the word. If you are unable to guess the reading of the word before revealing the entire sentence, then the card must be marked as a fail . After guessing the reading of the word, you can optionally click on the word to reveal the entire sentence to guess the definition. In other words, if you can only guess the definition by reading the sentence, then the card should still be passed. How to create: Fill the IsClickCard field. Hover Sentence Card \u00b6 This acts similarly to the hover vocab card. However, the tested content is the entire sentence, so you must hover over the word to test the entire sentence. Indicator: Colored word & dotted underline under the word. How to test: Attempt to guess the reading and definition of the word without hovering over the word. Regardless of whether you are able to guess the reading and definition of the word, hover over the word and test yourself on the sentence (as if it was a sentence card). How to create: Fill the IsHoverCard and IsSentenceCard fields. Click Sentence Card \u00b6 This acts similar to the click vocab card. However, similarly to the hover sentence card, the tested content is the entire display, so you must click the word to test the entire display Indicator: Colored word & dashed underline under the word. How to test: Attempt to guess the reading of the word without hovering over the word. If you are unable to guess the reading of the word before revealing the entire sentence, then the card must be marked as a fail . After guessing the reading of the word, click on the word to reveal the entire sentence, and test yourself on the sentence (as if it was a sentence card). How to create: Fill the IsClickCard and IsSentenceCard fields. Hybrid TSC \u00b6 Similarly to the normal TSC, if you want to use the hover sentence card or click sentence card to only test a specific portion of the sentence, you can bold the desired selection of the sentence and fill IsTargetedSentenceCard . The above example is a Hover TSC, with the last sentence bolded. Hybrid Hint Card \u00b6 Warning New as of version 0.12.0.0 . This version is currently bleeding edge , so this feature cannot be used unless you compile the templates from the dev branch. Hover Hint Click Hint TODO image TODO image Similarly to a normal hint card, filling the IsHintCard allows the hybrid card type to reveal the sentence below the word (instead of replacing the word). As this is simply a matter of style, you would test this like any normal hybrid card.

Although I was originally fine with this, I started to realize some issues with only having these two card types: Vocab cards that require context have to be turned into sentence cards, and Sentence cards take a very long time to review, and can create context-based memories. I found that many vocab cards had to be turned into sentence cards, since either the context was fundamental to understanding the definition, or there were other parts of the sentence that I wanted to test. This lead to many sentence cards, which naturally meant that Anki sessions lasted longer.

Note This page is primarily intended for monolingual dictionary users, as the sheer amount of possible monolingual dictionaries may require specific customizations for each individual dictionary. Dictionary Placement \u00b6 This section deals with how the custom Yomichan Templates categorizes dictionaries, and how to properly customize them for your setup. Expected Dictionary Placement \u00b6 Dictionaries from Yomichan are sorted into the following fields: PrimaryDefinition : A dictionary specified by the user. Bilingual by default. This can be changed in many different ways . SecondaryDefinition : All bilingual dictionaries outside of the one in PrimaryDefinition ExtraDefinitions : All monolingual dictionaries outside of the one in PrimaryDefinition UtilityDictionaries : All traditionally-formatted dictionaries that do not belong in any of the above categories (in other words, does not provide the meaning of the word). An example is the JMdict Surface Forms dictionary Note This does not include pitch accent dictionaries, frequency lists, or kanji dictionaries, as these are not traditionally-formatted dictionaries. The way that the dictionaries are sorted into the appropriate fields is by assigning a category to each individual dictionary. Verifying Categories \u00b6 You can check that your dictionaries are correctly categorized with the {jpmn-test-dict-type} marker. Under the Anki Templates code, replace Card field with {jpmn-test-dict-type} and press Test . An example output of the above (on the word \u7d50\u69cb) is the following: \u300c\u65fa\u6587\u793e\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \u7b2c\u5341\u4e00\u7248\u300d: monolingual \u300c\u660e\u93e1\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \u7b2c\u4e8c\u7248\u300d: monolingual \u300c\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u65b0\u8f9e\u6797\u300d: monolingual \u300c\u65b0\u660e\u89e3\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \u7b2c\u4e94\u7248\u300d: monolingual \u300c\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5927\u8f9e\u6cc9\u300d: monolingual \u300cNHK\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u767a\u97f3\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u65b0\u8f9e\u5178\u300d: utility \u300cJMDict Surface Forms\u300d: utility \u300cJMdict (English)\u300d: bilingual \u300cJMdict (English)\u300d: bilingual \u300cJMdict (English)\u300d: bilingual \u300cJMdict (English)\u300d: bilingual \u300cJMdict (English)\u300d: bilingual \u300c\u65b0\u548c\u82f1\u300d: bilingual If a dictionary is miscategorized, you will have to edit bilingual-dict-regex or utility-dict-regex at the top of the template code. Monolingual dictionaries are considered to be dictionaries that aren't either of the two above, so no handlebars code has to be changed if one were to use more monolingual dictionaries. To see how to edit the regex, go to this section . Ignoring a Dictionary \u00b6 If you want to see the dictionary on Yomichan but not have it show on Anki, you can use the ignored-dict-regex option. To see how to edit the option, see the section below . Conversely, if you want to not see the dictionary on Yomichan but want it to show up on Anki, see here . Note It is recommended to not use this option, so you have as much information as possible within the note. If you wish to not see a dictionary, it might be easier to collapse the dictionary . Editing the dictionary regex \u00b6 To modify a regex string: Determine the exact tag your dictionary has. To see this, take a word that has a definition in the desired dictionary, and test {jpmn-test-dict-type} like above. The string inside the quotes \u300c\u300d is exactly the tag of the dictionary. Add the dictionary tag to the string, by replacing ADD_x_DICTIONARIES_HERE . For example, if your bilingual dictionary tag is Amazing Dictionary , change ADD_BILINGUAL_DICTIONARIES_HERE to Amazing Dictionary . If you want to add more than one dictionary, they have to be joined with the | character. For example, if you want to add the bilingual dictionaries Amazing Dictionary and Somewhat-Okay-Dictionary , change ADD_BILINGUAL_DICTIONARIES_HERE to Amazing Dictionary|Somewhat-Okay-Dictionary .

This can be changed to the first monolingual dictionary by changing the following Yomichan template option to monolingual : {{ ~! valid values : \"bilingual\" , \"monolingual\" ~ }} {{ ~#set \"opt-first-definition-type\" \"monolingual\" }}{{ /set~ }} Manual Selection \u00b6 Sometimes, you may want to override the primary definition, or highlight the definition that makes sense with the context. By default, selecting (highlighting) the text will do nothing , to prevent any unexpected errors from happening. However, the user can set the following Yomichan template option to allow selecting text to override the automatic dictionary selection behavior: {{ ~! options related to selected text ~ }} {{ set \"opt-selection-text-enabled\" true }} Setting this option will enable the following behavior: If nothing is selected, then the first dictionary is chosen just like normal. If a dictionary is selected, then that dictionary will replace the first definition. To disable this, set opt-selection-text-dictionary to false . If a section of text is selected, then that dictionary will replace the first definition. Additionally, that section of text will be highlighted (bolded). To disable this, set opt-selection-text-glossary to false . Additionally, if you do not want to use the entire dictionary, and prefer that only the selected text is shown in the first definition, then set opt-selection-text-glossary-attempt-bold to false . Where automatic bolding can fail (click here) Automatic bolding may not always work: if the highlighted text could not be automatically detected from the custom template code, then it will fallback to simply using the highlighted text (as if you used the {selection-text} marker). This is most likely to fail if you select formatted parts of text, such as (but not limited to): line breaks furigana across multiple items in a list (common with JMdict) Where dictionary selection can fail (click here) This may occasionally select the wrong dictionary, but this only happens if the selected text also appears in a dictionary above the selected text. For example, suppose you have two bilingual dictionaries. and for the word \u30bf\u30b3, you highlight the word \"octopus\" and create the card. Both bilingual dictionaries will list \"octopus\", so even if you highlight the word \"octopus\" in the second bilingual dictionary, only the first bilingual dictionary will be chosen. This is usually not a problem even if the same text appears in a dictionary above because it's the same definition regardless. Additionally, monolingual dictionaries almost never have the exact same definition for the same word. However, if you still want a specific dictionary, highlight the dictionary tag as shown above . UI Options \u00b6 Hiding the first line of a definition \u00b6 See also: How to remove the numbers in the definition The first line of the definition has various elements that can be hidden with CSS . Nothing hidden (default) Hide extra text Hide dictionary tag Hide entire first line Nothing is hidden. This is the default behavior. This hides all the text to the right of the dictionary tag.

If you are using an older version of Anki (2.1.49 and below), see the note in the Anki-Connect setup section here . (Warning) JPMNOpts was not defined in the options file. Was there an error? \u00b6 If you see this as an isolated warning without any other errors, it is very likely that you are using Anki version 2.1.49 or below. Please check your Anki version to confirm this: Main Window \u2192 Help \u2192 About... If your Anki version is indeed 2.1.49 or below, then this should only appear on the front side of your first card of the session. To check, try flipping the card and back. This warning should dissappear once you do. The only side effect of this is that the user-defined runtime options will not be used for the front side of the first card, and the defaults will be used instead. There are two ways to fix this: Update Anki to a higher version. Compile the card with hard-coded defaults . Why this happens (click here) The <script ... src=\"_jpmn-options.js\"> tag seems to runs asynchronously on 2.1.49 and below, meaning that the order of when this is ran is not constant compared to the main javascript block. With that being said, the exact tag seems to run synchronously on 2.1.50 and above, so it is guaranteed to run before the main javascript block on these versions. With my current knowledge, the only way to guarantee the order of this import is asynchronous functions, or some other asynchronous features. For example, a simple await import(...) should work. However, asynchronous features have been avoided throughout the development of this, as it currently seems to behave unpredictably within Anki. General Error Troubleshooting \u00b6 If none of the above worked, the following will be some general troubleshooting tips that can help you figure out what the error is: Try disabling all of your add-ons other than the mandatory ones listed in the setup page. Note that you have to restart Anki after disabling the add-ons for the changes to take effect. If it works after this step, please let me know which add-on(s) conflicts with this note type! To do this, re-enable the add-ons one-by-one (remembering to restart Anki each time!). With all of your non-mandatory add-ons disabled, try to upgrade Anki to the latest version, and see if the issue still persists. If this works but an add-on you consider mandatory no longer works, please let me know! (I won't be able to upgrade the add-on for you, but I can potentially point to alternatives and/or add it to the documentation somewhere so others are aware of the issue.) If you can't manage to fix it, please reach out to me on Discord , or submit an issue ! Troubleshooting \u00b6 The SentenceReading field is not updated / is different from the Sentence field \u00b6 This happens because programs such as mpvacious and asbplayer update the sentence manually. For example, assume the subtitles are the following: \u3060\u3063\u3066\u3001\u9ebb\u8863\u3055\u3093\u306f\u9045\u523b\u3057\u3066\u304d\u305f\u7537\u3092\u3001\u5065\u6c17\u306b\u4e00\u6642\u9593\u4e09\u5341\u516b\u5206\u3082 \u5f85\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306a\u53ef\u611b\u3052\u306e\u3042\u308b\u5973\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\uff01\u3055\u3066\u306f \u507d\u7269 \u3060\u306a\uff01 If you make a card from the highlighted \u507d\u7269, the Sentence and SentenceReading field will only contain the text from the 2nd subtitle. If you then use mpvacious or asbplayer to grab both subtitles, the Sentence field will be updated, but the SentenceReading field will not be updated . Partial solutions Sometimes, the problem appears because one subtitle can span multiple lines. These partial solutions work to solve that problem. However, these do not work for when lines span multiple subtitles. For mpvacious, use a texthooker that can remove all whitespace (i.e. Renji's Texthooker ). For asbplayer, you can remove the line breaks in the subtitle file itself (i.e. with SubtitleEdit ) The only full solution I know to this is to disabling automatic furigana generation on card add . If you still want furigana on your cards, bulk generate it after each session. The word is incorrectly highlighted / not highlighted at all. \u00b6 The word is usually highlighted by default, but the word may not be highlighted for the following reasons: The sentence field got updated by an external program. The card was imported from an older deck that did not highlight the tested word. As of version 0.11.1.0 , the card will automatically attempt to highlight the word if the word was not highlighted in the first place. However, this highlight may yield incorrect results. This is expected behavior , and you are expected to manually bold the sentence if the highlight is incorrect. See here for more info. The frequency list display looks squished. \u00b6 This is because you are using Anki version 2.1.49 or below. There are two main ways of fixing this: Update to a higher version of Anki (recommended). If you do not wish to update Anki, add the following CSS : . frequencies__group { margin-left : 20 px ; } . frequencies-overflow { margin-left : 10 px ; } The Show/Hide button doesn't do anything. \u00b6 The show/hide button requires that the displayed sentence has a bolded element. For example, this means if the currently displayed sentence comes from the AltDisplay field and nothing in that field is bolded, then the show/hide button will do nothing. This potentially relates to the issue above. The replay audio button plays the sentence, word, and then sentence. \u00b6 This is playing the audio from the front of the card, and then the back of the card, in sequence. To fix it so you only hear the audio displayed in the back of the card, go to: Decks (main anki browser) \u2192 Deck settings (the gear beside your deck) \u2192 Options \u2192 Audio section \u2192 Toggle Skip question when replaying answer The Tools \u2192 Check Media interface removes the font files. \u00b6 This is a known bug, and unfortunately, this bug will not be fixed . If you want to use this tool, temporarily move the fonts outside of the media folder. If you accidentally removed the fonts, redownload the fonts and re-add them into the media folder of your profile. This will not be fixed because to make debugging easier for the developer. When a user is asked to export a card, the exported file will not contain the font files, meaning that the result .apkg file will be about 1MB instead of some 20MB, allowing it to be shared easily on a place like Discord. This card template loads slower than other card templates. \u00b6 Usually, this is not very noticeable on faster computers. However, the card may load slower compared to others if you are on a slow computer. Note for Android (Ankidroid) Unfortunately, it seems like Ankidroid has a specific issue where fonts are loaded extremely slowly. This appears to be a problem with the chrome webview itself (see: Ankidroid issue , Chromium issue ). This means outside of removing the custom fonts, there is no feasible way to considerably speed up Ankidroid. From person experiments, simply removing the fonts without changing anything else on jp-mining-note results in almost instanteous load times. This is in comparison to the same template with custom fonts included, which results in near one second load times. There are some ways to remedying this. Both will inevitably remove certain features of the note. (1) Prevent document reflow By default, the mobile interface will not have any document reflow , so nothing has to be done for mobile. However, on PC, the default settings forces document reflow every time the back-side of the card is loaded. On faster computers, this effect is virtually neglible. However, this effect is more noticeable on lower end computers. To prevent document reflow, you must change the following two runtime options : { \"modules\" : { \"img-utils\" : { \"resize-height-mode\" : \"fixed\" , // (1)! \"primary-definition-picture\" : { \"use-lenience\" : false , // (2)! } } } } Set this to anything OTHER THAN \"auto-height\". This may affect the display image size in an undesireably way, because the height of the display image will no longer be automatically adjusted. Set this to false. (2) Using compile-time options Outside of document reflow, it appears that most of the lag doesn't come from the javascript execution, but rather the fact that the note has a lot of HTML (Anki's internal html and template parser) and javascript text (javascript compilation time). Surprisingly, the time it takes for javascript to actually run is comparatively fast if the forced document reflow (see above) is remedied. Both the amount of HTML and javascript can be reduced at the cost of removing functionality using the following compile-time options : \"hardcoded-runtime-options\" : True , // (1)! \"always-filled-fields\" : [], // (2)! \"never-filled-fields\" : [], \"enabled-modules\" : [ ... ], // (3)! This removes extra javascript. To customize the runtime-options, you will need to specify your options in a different file (TODO). Fill these two fields accordingly, depending on whether you use the fields or not. Remove any modules you do not need. This is the biggest change you can do to increase the note's performance. An example for a very optimized vocab card is shown here . Note that img-utils-minimal will still cause a document reflow unless you change the above options. The sentence quotes are on completely different lines! \u00b6 If your card looks like this: then your Sentence field is likely formatted internally similar to the following example: < div > \u305d\u3046\u30c7\u30b9\u30b5\u30fc\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u51f8\u5b88\u3092 < b > \u5dee\u3057\u7f6e\u3044\u3066 </ b ></ div > < div > \u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u884c\u52d5\u3092\u5171\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3068\u306f\u4e07\u6b7b\u306b\u5024\u3059\u308b\u30c7\u30fc\u30b9 </ div > To fix this, edit the Sentence field html to remove the <div> tags, and add <br> tags wherever a line break should appear. For example, the above should be changed into: \u305d\u3046\u30c7\u30b9\u30b5\u30fc\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u51f8\u5b88\u3092 < b > \u5dee\u3057\u7f6e\u3044\u3066 </ b >< br > \u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u884c\u52d5\u3092\u5171\u306b\u3059\u308b\u3068\u306f\u4e07\u6b7b\u306b\u5024\u3059\u308b\u30c7\u30fc\u30b9 Why this can happen (click here) This happens if you copy/paste directly from certain pages into the sentence field, such as some texthooker pages. This can also happen if you copy/paste from a texthooker page to a different field, say AdditionalNotes , and then copy a section of AdditionalNotes to Sentence . The updating sentence with clipboard hotkey shouldn't have this problem, as <div> tags are not present by default. Card Editing \u00b6 How do I set the default card type? \u00b6 In Yomichan's Anki Card Format , you can simply fill the field. For example, if you want to set the default card type to be a sentence card, fill the IsSentenceCard field there. How do I automatically change the value of a binary field on multiple existing cards? \u00b6 You have three main options: Warning As always, before mass editing your collection, please backup your Anki data . Batch Editing Addon Python script: # assuming you are at the root of the repo, # i.e. after the `git clone ...` and `cd jp-mining-note` cd ./tools # sets all `IsSentenceCard` fields to be filled python3 batch.py --fill-field \"IsSentenceCard\" # empties all `IsSentenceCard` fields python3 batch.py --empty-field \"IsSentenceCard\" Regex Search (TODO) How do I disable furigana on card generation? \u00b6 In Yomichan's Anki Card Format , ensure that the SentenceReading field is empty. If you are using the AJT Furigana addon, navigate to: AJT \u2192 Japanese Options \u2192 Furigana \u2192 Select profile: Add furigana for sentence \u2192 Triggered by \u2192 Uncheck Note Added . You likely want to bulk-generate the furigana if you are disabling furigana on card generation. See the question below to do just that. How do I bulk generate furigana and pitch accents? \u00b6 Head to the Card Browser window: Main Window \u2192 Browse Select all notes without furigana, with the following search: \"note:JP Mining Note\" SentenceReading: Head over to: Edit (top left corner) \u2192 AJT: Bulk-generate . Note Bulk generating pitch accents will only batch generate the AJTWordPitch field. Pitch accent graphs and positions cannot be automatically generated. This is important to note if you are using colored pitch accent. If PAPositions is not filled, then the card cannot be automatically colored. In version 0.12.0.0 , this no longer matters, because the pitch accent info is properly parsed from AJTWordPitch. Note There may be some cards that still have an empty AJTWordPitch field. This is simply because the add-on did not contain the pitch data for those words. How do I remove an empty card without deleting the entire note? \u00b6 Quote To remove the empty cards, go to Tools \u2192 Empty Cards in the main window. You will be shown a list of empty cards and be given the option to delete them. Taken directly from Anki's official documentation . How do I edit the field's raw HTML? \u00b6 Within the card browser, select a field to edit, and then type ctrl+shift+x . Alternatively, on newer versions of Anki, you can click on the top-right corner on the code button. How do I use this note type as an Anime Card? \u00b6 An anime card is a vocab card with a picture and (native) sentence audio, which is the default setup for this card. If you want to add hints that aren't collapsed by default, use the HintNotHidden field. Other Questions \u00b6 Where is the (X) folder in Anki? \u00b6 You must first locate the Anki2 folder. The location of this folder is different for each operating system. Quote Windows Mac Linux On Windows , the latest Anki versions store your Anki files in your appdata folder. You can access it by opening the file manager, and typing %APPDATA%\\Anki2 in the location field. Older versions of Anki stored your Anki files in a folder called Anki in your Documents folder. On Mac computers, recent Anki versions store all their files in the ~/Library/Application Support/Anki2 folder. The Library folder is hidden by default, but can be revealed in Finder by holding down the option key while clicking on the Go menu. If you're on an older Anki version, your Anki files will be in your Documents/Anki folder. On Linux , recent Anki versions store your data in ~/.local/share/Anki2 , or $XDG_DATA_HOME/Anki2 if you have set a custom data path. Older versions of Anki stored your files in ~/Documents/Anki or ~/Anki . Taken directly from Anki's official documentation . Your profile folder is under Anki2/PROFILE_NAME . Your media folder is under Anki2/PROFILE_NAME/collections.media . Your addons folder is under Anki2/addons21 . How do I backup my Anki data? \u00b6 The following makes a complete backup of your collection, including media: Main Window \u2192 File (top left corner) \u2192 Export... \u2192 Anki Collection Package The following makes a temporary backup of your collection, not including media: Main Window \u2192 File (top left corner) \u2192 Create Backup See Anki's official documentation for more info. How do I backup Yomichan settings? \u00b6 Navigate to Yomichan Settings. Go to the Backup section Select Export Settings How do I export notes? \u00b6 Navigate to the Card Browser, by doing the following: Main Window \u2192 Browse Select a note. Hold down ctrl to select multiple individual notes. Right click the selected notes, and navigate to: Notes \u2192 Export Notes... How do I see the version of jp-mining-note? \u00b6 Preview any card. The version should be displayed at the top left corner. For mobile, the version be shown at the top right corner. Note that this is only displayed on mobile for versions 0.11.1.0 and above. How do I see the version of Anki? \u00b6 Navigate to: Help \u2192 About What card type should I use? \u00b6 The short answer is: whichever one you want. :) The long answer is: whichever one you want, because everyone has their own preferences on what card types they like. I recommend being open about it and experiment with them, to see which one you like. What is the point of the PASilence field? \u00b6 This is a hack to not play the sentence audio on the front side, even if you set-up your Anki client to do so. With this field filled correctly, the play sentence audio button will appear at the front, and will not be autoplayed. Leaving this field empty will affect cards where you test pitch accent, i.e. with PAShowInfo filled. In particular, this will cause Anki to autoplay the sentence audio on the front side of cards that test pitch accent, which is undesirable. Do you plan on supporting any other language other than Japanese? \u00b6 Unfortunately, other languages outside of Japanese will not be supported. The reason for this decision is best explained in the \"When are you going to add support for $MYLANGUAGE?\" question within Yomichan's README : Quote Developing Yomichan requires a decent understanding of Japanese sentence structure and grammar, and other languages are likely to have their own unique set of rules for syntax, grammar, inflection, and so on. Supporting additional languages would not only require many additional changes to the codebase, it would also incur significant maintenance overhead and knowledge demands for the developers. Therefore, suggestions and contributions for supporting new languages will be declined, allowing Yomichan's focus to remain Japanese-centric.

FrequencySort YomichanWordTags SecondaryDefinition ExtraDefinitions UtilityDictionaries Comment Modifying the Front Side (Tested Content) \u00b6 The front side is exactly the content that we want to test ourselves on. Naturally, since we can test ourselves on many aspects of the word, there are many ways to change this tested content. Card types \u00b6 Main Page: Card Types The default card type is a vocab card, where the tested content is simply the word. To change the card to a sentence card, fill the IsSentenceCard binary field. Vocab card Sentence card AltDisplay: Changing the Displayed Content \u00b6 Vocab cards show the Word field and sentence cards show the Sentence fields by default. However, you can modify what is exactly shown in the front by using the AltDisplay field. Newline Last sentence only The previous sentence card looks a little ugly, because the sentence splits off at a strange point. To fix this, we add a newline at a sensible place (after the period) in the AltDisplay field. Alternatively, we can simply test the last sentence, by removing the first sentence. AltDisplay: Furigana \u00b6 One nice feature is that the AltDisplay has hoverable furigana text enabled by default. In other words, you can use furigana in the field. I personally use this to insert furigana for certain names, since I'm usually not testing myself on how to read a name. For example, the card below has the following HTML: \u4e0a\u6761[\u304b\u307f\u3058\u3087\u3046] \u606d\u4ecb[\u304d\u3087\u3046\u3059\u3051]\u541b\u306e\u3053\u3068\u304a < b > \u6155\u3044 </ b > \u3057\u3066\u307e\u3057\u305f\u306e AltDisplay: Final Notes \u00b6 The example with adding a newline to AltDisplay is somewhat contrived. More realistically, you would want to add the newline to the Sentence field. If you are using AJT Furigana , I recommend deleting the text within the SentenceReading field before editing the Sentence field, so the furigana can be automatically generated with the newly formatted Sentence field. If you are using a vocab card, you can use AltDisplay to show something that differs from the Word field. On Hybrid Card types, the AltDisplay field only affects the sentence, and not the front displayed word. Hints \u00b6 Finally, you can include a customized hint to show at the front of the card, by using the Hint field. This will show as a collapsible field at the front of card. If you do not want the hint to be hidden by default, you can use the HintNotHidden field instead. Hint HintNotHidden Modifying the Back Side \u00b6 The main two fields that one can add text to is PrimaryDefinition and AdditionalNotes . Bolding anything in these sections will highlight the word in a light yellow (or blue in light mode) tint, to make the bolded text stand out more. PrimaryDefinition field \u00b6 The PrimaryDefinition field contains the main content, and should be the main field to edit if one wants to put down more notes about the card. AdditionalNotes field \u00b6 The AdditionalNotes field is useful if you want to write down even more notes, but keep it in a collapsible field to reduce vertical space. Here are some suggestions on how you can use this field: Recording the source where the scene came from Adding custom notes on the scene's context Recording the sentences surrounding the mined sentence In general, this field should be used for any info that is not crucial to understanding the tested content. Modifying Images & Pitch Accent \u00b6 As there are plenty of ways to modify images and pitch accent, they are discussed in their respective pages: Images ( Picture and PrimaryDefinitionPicture ) Pitch Accent ( PAOverride and PAOverrideText ) Testing Pitch Accent \u00b6 This note type provides many options to target exactly what parts of pitch accent you want to test yourself on. By default, no special indicator is shown on whether pitch accent is tested or not. To test for pitch accent, fill the PAShowInfo field. You should see a circle to the left of the word or sentence. Pitch Accent Indicator \u00b6 This circle you see is called the \"Pitch Accent Indicator\", or \"PA Indicator\" for short. How this card indicates what pitch accent is tested is by the PA indicator's color. Here are what the colors represent: Green: The entire sentence is tested. Blue: Only the word is tested. Red: Pitch accent should not be tested in any way. If you ever forget what the colors mean, you can hover your mouse over the circle to get a description of what is being tested. Alternatively, you can look at the top right of the screen and look at the value after the / . Note If the tested content is a sentence (card), but you want to only test for word pitch accent, you would not be able to see the word normally. To see the word that is tested, there is a button to toggle whether the word is highlighted or not. The content that is highlighted is exactly what is bolded in the Sentence (or AltDisplay / AltDisplayPASentenceCard ) field, which is the added word by default. Note If your card is a vocab card, then full sentence is shown as a collapsed field by default. This is only here to check your hearing with your guessed pitch accent, when used in conjunction with the sentence play button. Selecting the Pitch Accent \u00b6 The following shows how to fill in the proper fields to test pitch accent: Filled fields PA Indicator Separated Cards (None, default) (Doesn't exist) PAShowInfo Green (sentence) or blue (word), depending on the tested content PAShowInfo & PADoNotTest Red (not tested) PAShowInfo & PATestOnlyWord Blue (word) PAShowInfo & PASeparateWordCard Red (not tested) Word PAShowInfo & PASeparateSentenceCard Blue (word) Sentence PAShowInfo & PASeparateWordCard & PASeparateSentenceCard Red (not tested) Word & Sentence To clarify some of the above: By default, if only PAShowInfo is filled, then the entire display is tested For vocab cards, targeted sentence cards, and hybrid vocab cards, only the word PA is tested (PA indicator: blue). For sentence cards and hybrid sentence, the entire sentence PA is tested (PA indicator: green). To test just the word pitch accent, fill the PATestOnlyWord field. To create completely separate cards to just test pitch accent on, use the fields PASeparateSentenceCard and/or PASeparateWordCard . If a PA word card is created, then the default card does not test pitch accent. Similarly, if a PA sentence card is created, then the default card only tests the word pitch accent. Modifying Pitch Accent Sentence Cards \u00b6 The field AltDisplayPASentenceCard exists to customize the display of the PA sentence card, if it exists. It works similarly to AltDisplay , and takes priority over AltDisplay in the PA sentence card. Colored Quotes Instead of PA Indicator \u00b6 (TODO) Runtime Options: \"modules\": { \"sent-utils\": { \"pa-indicator-color-quotes\": ... } } TODO picture comparisons between word PA indicator in quotes / word PA with PA indicator Other Fields \u00b6 Key field \u00b6 This contains the tested word. In other words, this contains the exact same content as the field below, but this field is specifically not used in the card template. This is to allow the user to modify the key if duplicates arise, while still being able to test the word. For example, if I were to test different usages of \u4e0a, I can change this key value to \u4e0a (preposition) , \u4e0a (grammar) , etc. and add a new card. It is expected that this Key field is unique; a warning will appear on cards that have a duplicate key. Comment field \u00b6 Similarly to the Key field, this field will not be used in any card template. In other words, this is a place where you can write down notes without affecting the card itself. FrequencySort field \u00b6 By default, this note type comes with a FrequencySort field, which is the equivalent of Marv's Frequency field in this guide. Visit the aformentioned link (and scroll down to Usage ) to see how to sort and review your cards by frequency. Note I personally use this field by re-ordering only some of the most common words in my deck, and then separating it with a step of 1. This ensures that every card in the deck will eventually be reached. Cloze Deletion Cards \u00b6 Warning I recently realized that I attached the wrong name to these cards. These should be simply known as \"Audio cards\", i.e. word audio card or sentence audio card. Although \"Cloze Deletion\" will be used throughout the templates and documentation, it will be renamed to \"Audio cards\" when version 0.12.0.0 releases. Cloze Deletion cards are, simply put, \"fill-in-the-blank cards\". This allows you to create cards that tests word audio or sentence audio. To create a cloze deletion card, simply fill in the SeparateClozeDeletionCard field. The words that are hidden are exactly the words that are bolded in the Sentence (or AltDisplay ) field.

For the best looking cards, it is recommended that you use images with aspect ratios between 16:9 (landscape) to 1:1 (square). (TODO screenshots) Note Instead of a picture, it is possible to use text within the Picture field. This is useful if you forgot to add the picture (or didn't want to add it in the first place), and would like to describe the scene in words.

If you have an image and would like to add text, add the text in the PrimaryDefinition or AdditionalNotes field. If you want to add more than one image, add the remaining images under PrimaryDefinitionPicture or PrimaryDefinition . Automatically Add Images Using Tags \u00b6 New in version 0.11.0.0 (latest version: 0.11.0.4 ) One can automatically add a specific image if a card contains a specific tag. This is particularily useful for cards made from written media, such as books. One can save an image of the cover (in the media folder), and add the appropriate tag to all of the cards to automatically set the image to the cover of the book. This is specified under the runtime options : \"modules\" : { \"img-utils\" : { \"add-image-if-contains-tags\" : [ ... ] } } Example: \"add-image-if-contains-tags\" : [ { \"tags\" : [ \"\u9752\u6625\u30d6\u30bf\u91ce\u90ce\u30fbLN1\" ], \"file-name\" : \"_\u9752\u6625\u30d6\u30bf\u91ce\u90ce-LN1.png\" } ], TODO example gif Collapsed Images \u00b6 Any customly inserted images, including images inserted directly by Yomichan, will be converted to text which you have to hover over to reveal. Of course, this image can also be clicked on to zoom. See the video demo below to see exactly what happens. How to Disable Collapsed Images \u00b6 There are three ways of disabling collapsed images. Place your images in the PrimaryDefinitionPicture field, as shown in the section below . To disable this for only specific images, edit the HTML of the desired field, and add data-do-not-convert=\"true\" . An example is shown below: < img src = \"your_image.png\" data-do-not-convert = \"true\" > Disable it globally in the runtime options : \"img-utils\" : { \"stylize-images-in-glossary\" : false , // ... } The PrimaryDefinitionPicture Field \u00b6 New in version 0.11.0.0 (latest version: 0.11.0.4 ) This field can be used to place images in the Primary Definition section without collapsing the image. Large images are automatically resized to fit the area. This is useful if one wants to put images in place of, or to suppliment definitions. For example, using images for words such as \"frog\" or \"chair\" is much easier to understand compared to using the monolingual definition. Right of the definition (Default) Below the definition Above the definition No Definition (\u7a81\u3063\u4f0f\u3059) Usually, the image is placed to the right (like on Wikipedia). (\u96d1\u5dfe) If there is too little text, the image is automatically positioned below the text. This will happen if there are only one or two lines of text for the definition. (\u96d1\u5dfe) If there is too little text and the correct options are set, the image is automatically positioned above the text. (\u96d1\u5dfe) Naturally, the picture appears to the left if there is no definition. As of version 0.11.1.0 , the size of the picture will also be slightly increased. Note Although not recommended, the PrimaryDefinitionPicture does not need to contain pictures. For example, one can add text, tables, or links to the field. Changing Automatic Positioning Behavior \u00b6 Warning New as of version 0.11.1.0 . This version is currently bleeding edge , so this feature cannot be used unless you compile the templates from the dev branch. There are a few runtime options that affect where the picture is positioned. position option : \"modules\" : { \"img-utils\" : { \"primary-definition-picture\" : { // Valid options (case sensitive): \"auto-bottom\", \"auto-top\", \"bottom\", \"right\", \"top\" \"position\" : \"auto-bottom\" , } } } The options bottom , right , and top force the image to always be placed below, to the right, and above the definition, respectively. auto-bottom is the default behavior, and will automatically position the picture below the definition if there is too little text. auto-top does the opposite: the picture will be positioned above the definition if there is too little text. Both auto-bottom and auto-top will position the picture to the right if there is sufficient amounts of text. position-lenience option : \"modules\" : { \"img-utils\" : { \"primary-definition-picture\" : { // Any integer \"position-lenience\" : ... } } } This is a constant that allows the picture to be placed to the right even if the text height is positionLenience times smaller than the picture. The exact formula used is the following: positionToRight = (textHeight * positionLenience) > picHeight use-lenience option : \"modules\" : { \"img-utils\" : { \"primary-definition-picture\" : { // Valid options: true, false \"use-lenience\" : ... } } } Setting this to false is equivalent of setting the position-lenience to a very large number. This will cause the picture to be placed to the right if there is ANY text, and placed to the left if there is no text. Force Positioning \u00b6 The automatic repositioning as described above may not be perfect. Fortunately, there are ways to force the position of this image, by adding any of the following tags to the card: img-right forces the image to be to the right. img-bottom forces the image to be below the text. img-top forces the image to be above the text. Image Blur \u00b6 New in version 0.10.3.0 (latest version: 0.11.0.4 ) Images on cards can be automatically blurred by marking it with a NSFW tag. To mark a card as NSFW, add any of the following tags to the card: nsfw \u30fb NSFW \u30fb -NSFW This behavior is disabled by default . In other words, you will not be able to blur images unless the following setting is explicitly enabled in the runtime options : Enabling image blur (click here) \"img-utils\" : { \"enabled\" : true , // (1)! \"nsfw-toggle\" : { \"enabled\" : true , // ... } } The img-utils module must be enabled to use the image blur feature. Note Recall that you can use custom text in the Picture field instead of having an actual picture. This is useful if you simply don't want to save a particular image. Change Review Session State \u00b6 The above demo shows how you can un-blur an image temporarily. This means that if you see that card again during the same review session, the image will be blurred again. This state can be changed for a review session. To toggle between review-session states, hover over the info circle, and click on the eyeball to the top left. This state will be maintained for the entire review session, but will be lost on the next session. The tabs below show the available states. By default, states cycle from left to right. Only Blur if NSFW Always Blurred Always Revealed Not Marked Marked (with NSFW tag) Not Marked Marked (with NSFW tag) Not Marked Marked (with NSFW tag) Demos (click here) Regular, unmarked card Card marked as NSFW Note Both examples have the info circle toggled (clicked), so the tooltip persists. Additional Details \u00b6 The eyeball to toggle the blur between an image will not be shown unless the card is marked as NSFW (or the review session state is \"Always Blurred\"). Clicking on the blurred image will do nothing; you must click on the eye to un-blur the image. Forcing the user to click in a smaller area makes accidental reveals less common. After revealing the image, you can click on the image to zoom, as normal. You cannot click on a blurred image to zoom. Most things can be changed in the runtime options, including what tags can be used, the default initial state on PC/mobile, etc. This was heavily inspired by Marv's implementation of the same feature.","title":"Images"},{"location":"images/#main-image","text":"The main image (shown to the right of the word reading) is exactly the contents of the Picture field.

Note If you are simply importing old JPMN notes, updating JPMN will properly update all the notes in place. See this section instead. Introduction \u00b6 Unfortunately, there are so many card formats out there that it would be impossible to cover how to import from every format with detailed rigor. Instead, this section will give you some general tips on operations that will likely be common across most or all formats, as well as present a small example for Anime Cards. Additionally, although you maybe able to import most of the card, it is unlikely that you will have complete 100% full functionality after importing the notes. The biggest example is frequency list information, as it requires special HTML + css formatting that can only be specified in the Yomichan Templates section. Prerequisites \u00b6 Before doing anything that affects your Anki collection in a major way (for example, basically everything on this page), please make a complete backup of your collection. Note Transferring your previous notes shouldn't change your media files at all. However I recommend exporting with media just in case, so long as you have the disk space for it. Anki \u00b6 Anki provides a feature to switch between note types, without affecting scheduling information. To do this, follow the proceeding steps: Head to the Card Browser window: Main Window \u2192 Browse Select all the cards that you want to switch. Tip ctrl+a selects all cards in the browser. Right click the selection \u2192 Notes \u2192 Change Note Type... Mapping Fields \u00b6 Here is where I can't give specific advice, as every note is different. However, here are a few tips: Map Word to Key and Word . Your card likely doesn't have a separate Key and Word field, and instead only contains one Word field. To import this correctly into JPMN, make sure JPMN's Key and Word field are exactly your old card's Word field. Leave AJTWordPitch and SentenceReading empty. These fields can be empty as AJT Japanese can batch generate both word pitches and sentence furigana. You may have some word pitch fields already in your card. Pitch accent graphs should be mapped to PAGraphs , and pitch accent positions should be mapped to PAPositions . Note that if you plan to use colored pitch accent on old cards, you must have a pitch accent positions field. 2 FrequencySort maps to the frequency value used to sort by frequency, which works exactly the same as Marv's Frequency field as documented in this page. If you have a field that stores the source of the media, I recommend mapping that to AdditionalNotes . The WordReading field should ideally be a simplified furigana format. For example, if the word is \u6210\u308a\u7acb\u3064, this field should be \u300c\u6210[\u306a]\u308a \u7acb[\u305f]\u3064\u300d. If you do not have any field that resembles this, use the kana reading (\u306a\u308a\u305f\u3064) or true furigana ( \u6210 \u306a \u308a \u7acb \u305f \u3064), and continue with the steps below. I recommend not setting FrequenciesStylized to anything, even if you have a field for frequency lists 1 . An example with Anime cards is shown below. Example for Anime Cards (click here) jp-mining-note fields Anime Cards Fields Key front Word front WordReading Reading PAOverride PAOverrideText AJTWordPitch PrimaryDefinition Glossary PrimaryDefinitionPicture Sentence Sentence SentenceReading AltDisplay AltDisplayPASentenceCard AdditionalNotes IsSentenceCard IsClickCard IsHoverCard IsTargetedSentenceCard PAShowInfo PATestOnlyWord PADoNotTest PASeparateWordCard PASeparateSentenceCard SeparateClozeDeletionCard Hint HintNotHidden Hint Picture Picture WordAudio Audio SentenceAudio SentenceAudio PAGraphs Graph PAPositions PASilence WordReadingHiragana FrequenciesStylized FrequencySort SecondaryDefinition ExtraDefinitions UtilityDictionaries Comment Note Anything not specified should be set to (Nothing) Batch Editing \u00b6 After switching your notes, you will have to do the following few steps: (1) Correctly Formatting Sentence Field \u00b6 If your sentence fields have been highlighted in a way that isn't using <b> , then it will be incompatable with JPMN by default. To see what the formatting of the sentence is, view the raw HTML of the Sentence field. Sentences are usually formatted in one of three ways, as shown below: (1) Highlighted with <b> (2) Nothing is highlighted (3) Highlighted, but not with <b> If the tested content is highlighted with <b> , then it is already formatted correctly. You can skip this step . Example: \u4eca\u65e5\u3082\u3001\u306a\u3093\u304b\u3001\u663c < b > \u7206\u7761 </ b > \u3057\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u3093\u306e\u3067\u2026 The note comes with a feature to automatically highlight the word within the sentence. However, this is an imperfect solution, and there is currently no easy way to add accurate highlighting to existing sentences. As there is nothing to do, you can skip this step . Example: \u4eca\u65e5\u3082\u3001\u306a\u3093\u304b\u3001\u663c\u7206\u7761\u3057\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u3093\u306e\u3067\u2026 If the tested content is highlighted with something that isn't <b> , then continue with the following instructions to change it. Example: \u4eca\u65e5\u3082\u3001\u306a\u3093\u304b\u3001\u663c < span style = \"color: #ffc2c7\" > \u7206\u7761 </ span > \u3057\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u3093\u306e\u3067\u2026 Instructions to port formatted sentences (click here) Note You may want to make another backup before doing the following, just in case. Determine how the sentence is formatted. We will be using the above for this example. This example highlights the word using a <span> with a custom color. \u4eca\u65e5\u3082\u3001\u306a\u3093\u304b\u3001\u663c < span style = \"color: #ffc2c7\" > \u7206\u7761 </ span > \u3057\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u3093\u306e\u3067\u2026 The above is created from the following Yomichan fields: {cloze-prefix}<span style=\"color: #ffc2c7\">{cloze-body}</span>{cloze-suffix} Testing the Conversion. In the Anki card viewer, select only one of your old notes. Afterwards, right click the selection, and head over to: Notes \u2192 Find and Replace... Setting the fields. Set the Find field to something that can find your highlighted content. We will use the above as an example. It is extremely likely that you will have to change the Find field according to your note's sentence format. Field name Value Find: <span style=\"color: #ffc2c7\">(?P<t>.*?)</span> Replace With: <b>$t</b> In: Sentence Selected notes only Checked ( ) Ignore case Unchecked ( ) Treat input as a regular expression Checked ( ) Example image (click here) Verify. Press Ok, and then preview the card. If the highlight is yellow (or blue on light mode), then it it was successful! Repeat steps 2 and 3, except select all of the affected notes instead of just one. If it was not successful, you likely have to adjust the Find field. See here to see Anki's official documentation on regex. (2) Batch generate pitch accents and sentence furigana \u00b6 This step requires the AJT Japanese addon to be correctly setup . Although this step is optional, pitch accents likely won't show for imported cards if you had nothing to import into PAPositions . In that case, this step is highly recommended. Head to the Card Browser window: Main Window \u2192 Browse Select all of your newly imported notes. Tip The following query should reveal all of your newly imported notes. Make sure you include the double quotes in the query search. \"note:JP Mining Note\" Afterwards, you can do ctrl+a to select all of the resulting cards. Head over to: Edit (top left corner) \u2192 AJT: Bulk-generate . (3) Batch Set PASilence Field \u00b6 This will ensure all PASilence are filled correctly. See here to understand what this field does. This can be done within Anki itself, or with Python. Within Anki With Python Head to the Card Browser window. Right click a card, and then head to: Notes \u2192 Find and Replace... Set the fields to the following: Field name Value Find: .* Replace With: [sound:_silence.wav] In: PASilence (IMPORTANT! Do not forget this field!) Selected notes only Unchecked ( ) Ignore case Unchecked ( ) Treat input as a regular expression Checked ( ) Example image (click here) # assuming you are at the root of the repo, # i.e. after the `git clone ...` and `cd jp-mining-note` cd ./tools # make sure you have Anki open and Anki-Connect installed! python3 ./batch.py -f \"set_pasilence_field\" (4) Correctly Formatting WordReading Field \u00b6 Your WordReading field is likely formatted in one of three ways: Furigana (plain) Furigana Kana only This is generated with the {furigana-plain} marker. Example: \u6210[\u306a]\u308a \u7acb[\u305f]\u3064 If your WordReading field is formatted this way, then the WordReading field is already formatted correctly. You can skip this step . This is generated with the {furigana} marker. Example: \u6210 \u306a \u308a \u7acb \u305f \u3064 (HTML: <ruby>\u6210<rt>\u306a</rt></ruby>\u308a<ruby>\u7acb<rt>\u305f</rt></ruby>\u3064 ) If your WordReading field is formatted this way, it would be ideal to convert this into plain furigana so the note can properly parse the field. Instructions for converting furigana into plain furigana (click here) Head to the Card Browser window. Right click a card, and then head to: Notes \u2192 Find and Replace... Set the fields to the following: Field name Value Find: <ruby>(<rb>)?(?P<kanji>.*?)(</rb>)?<rt>(?P<furigana>.*?)</rt></ruby> Replace With: $kanji[$furigana] (Keep the whitespace at the beginning!) In: WordReading Selected notes only Unchecked ( ) Ignore case Unchecked ( ) Treat input as a regular expression Checked ( ) This is generated with the {reading} marker. Example: \u306a\u308a\u305f\u3064 This means that your old cards only have a kana reading. It would be ideal to have the WordReading as the kanji word with furigana. You likely want the kanji word with the furigana, so the kanjis actually show in the proper places. Some examples include the kanji hover tooltip as well as to the left of the picture field. Instructions for converting kana readings into (plain) furigana (click here) The solution provided below is imperfect, but passable. This will format all of the WordReading fields to be Word[WordReading] , which means kana will repeated. For example, a card with Word as \u6210\u308a\u7acb\u3064, and WordReading as \u306a\u308a\u305f\u3064, will turn into: \u6210\u308a\u7acb\u3064 \u306a\u308a\u305f\u3064 To do this, you will have to run a Python script from the repository. For Windows users, see the first 3 steps for the Windows instructions here if you haven't use Python before. Afterwards, create a backup and run the following: Windows MacOS & Linux : : assuming you are in jp-mining-note/tools : : make sure you have Anki open and Anki-Connect installed! python batch.py -f \"quick_fix_convert_kana_only_reading_all_notes\" # assuming you are in jp-mining-note/tools # make sure you have Anki open and Anki-Connect installed! python3 batch.py -f \"quick_fix_convert_kana_only_reading_all_notes\" The above will affect ALL notes. If you instead want to affect certain notes, add the kanaonlyreading tag to all affected notes, and then run: Windows MacOS & Linux python batch.py -f \"quick_fix_convert_kana_only_reading_with_tag\" python3 batch.py -f \"quick_fix_convert_kana_only_reading_with_tag\" (5) (Optional) Batch set WordReadingHiragana Field \u00b6 New in version 0.11.0.0 (latest version: 0.11.0.4 ) The following automatically fills out the WordReadingHiragana field. Filling out the WordReadingHiragana field is optional but highly recommended. This will enable the usage of Word Indicators on existing cards. To do this, you will have to run a Python script. Again, for Windows users, if you have not used Python before, see the first 3 steps for the \"Windows\" instructions here . The following script assumes that Step 4 is done (which means your WordReading field is formatted as plain furigana). Do not run this script if you have not successfully completed Step 4.

Enjoy reviewing your old cards with a new template! FrequenciesStylized uses a custom set of handlebars to store the frequency info in a way that css styles can be easily applied without javascript. This differs heavily from the {frequencies} marker provided by Yomichan. Mapping an existing field that stores frequencies using {frequencies} to FrequenciesStylized will result in incorrect display of data . There is currently no convenience function to convert it to the proper format. Additionally, auto-generating frequency info (with the correct css, html, etc.) from arbitrary frequency lists does not seem trivial, and I currently provide no way of doing that (primarily because I'm not sure how to do it in the first place). If you know of a way or would like to help me out with doing this, please let me know! \u21a9 The current implementation of colored pitch accent cannot detect the pitch accent position from the svg graph, nor from the automatically generated pitch accent from AJT Pitch Accent . If you do not have a pitch accent positions field, the only way to have colored pitch accent on old cards is by manually setting the position for all affected cards. Of course, any new cards should have automatically generated pitch accent positions, so long as you have a Yomichan pitch accent dictionary installed. \u21a9","title":"Transfer Existing Notes"},{"location":"importing/#overview","text":"This section is dedicated to explaining how you can change other Anki cards into this note format.

However, here are a few tips: Map Word to Key and Word . Your card likely doesn't have a separate Key and Word field, and instead only contains one Word field. To import this correctly into JPMN, make sure JPMN's Key and Word field are exactly your old card's Word field. Leave AJTWordPitch and SentenceReading empty. These fields can be empty as AJT Japanese can batch generate both word pitches and sentence furigana. You may have some word pitch fields already in your card. Pitch accent graphs should be mapped to PAGraphs , and pitch accent positions should be mapped to PAPositions . Note that if you plan to use colored pitch accent on old cards, you must have a pitch accent positions field. 2 FrequencySort maps to the frequency value used to sort by frequency, which works exactly the same as Marv's Frequency field as documented in this page. If you have a field that stores the source of the media, I recommend mapping that to AdditionalNotes . The WordReading field should ideally be a simplified furigana format. For example, if the word is \u6210\u308a\u7acb\u3064, this field should be \u300c\u6210[\u306a]\u308a \u7acb[\u305f]\u3064\u300d. If you do not have any field that resembles this, use the kana reading (\u306a\u308a\u305f\u3064) or true furigana ( \u6210 \u306a \u308a \u7acb \u305f \u3064), and continue with the steps below.

Master Project List \u00b6 This contains the list of all my current projects that relate to learning Japanese. jp-mining-note jp-mining-note is a highly customizable Anki card template for studying Japanese, designed to be visually appealing and simple to use without sacrificing functionality. Easily paired with most automatic card creation workflows, this aims to make your experience with Anki as smooth as possible. Local Audio Server for Yomichan This Anki add-on runs a local server of which Yomichan can fetch audio files from, using a database containing over 200,000 unique expressions. With this setup, you are able to create Anki cards nearly instantaneously, and get word audio without a working internet connection. All Anki note templates I can find I catalogue all note templates I can possibly find (that isn't jp-mining-note, and made for learning Japanese) here. JMdict (English) for Yomichan This simply contains a Yomichan dictionary version of JMdict (English) from the main website (from files JMdict_e and JMdict_e_examp ), compiled using yomichan-import . (Disclaimer: I did not make any of these tools.) This repository exists to simply give people a more up-to-date version of this dictionary, for people who don't want to compile the dictionary themselves. A more up-to-date version of JMdict usually provides better definitions and coverage compared to older versions, so I would recommend updating this dictionary every few months.

Add the CSS to the top section. Close the window. Demo (click here) Not selecting or copying furigana \u00b6 If you want to select / copy the main word within Yomichan without copying the furigana, you can use the following CSS: . headword-term ruby rt { user-select : none ; } Note The above is actually general enough to use for Anki cards itself, say with the following CSS: ruby rt { user-select : none ; } Limiting the number of frequency lists \u00b6 /* Only shows the first 2 frequency lists */ span . frequency-group-item : nth-child ( n + 3 ) { display : none ; } (Thanks Marv#5144 for the CSS.

However, if you disable the dictionary, you cannot export it into Anki, which is a problem if you are using a bilingual profile but you want to export monolingual definitions. Steps : Ensure that the dictionary is enabled in your Yomichan profile.

Template code (click here) {{ ~#*inline \"glossary-first\" ~ }} {{ ~#scope~ }} {{ ~#set \"first-dictionary\" null }}{{ /set~ }} {{ ~#each definition.definitions ~ }} {{ ~#if (op \"== = \" null (get \" first-dictionary \"))~}} {{~#set \" first-dictionary \" dictionary~}}{{~/set~}} {{~/if~}} {{~/each~}} {{~#if (op \" != = \" null (get \" first-dictionary \"))~}} <div style=\" text-align : left ; \"><ol> {{~#each definition.definitions~}} {{~#if (op \" == = \" dictionary (get \" first-dictionary \" )) ~ }} <li> {{ ~> glossary-single . brief = ../brief noDictionaryTag = ../noDictionaryTag ~ }} </li> {{ ~/if~ }} {{ ~/each~ }} </ol></div> {{ ~/if~ }} {{ ~/scope~ }} {{ ~/inline~ }} Automatically highlight the tested word within the sentence upon card creation \u00b6 Option 1: Bold only Yomichan Fields : {cloze-prefix}<b>{cloze-body}</b>{cloze-suffix} Option 2: Bold + Styling (recommended) Yomichan Fields : {cloze-prefix}<b>{cloze-body}</b>{cloze-suffix} Anki Note CSS (the Styling page under the editing card templates page): b { color : #fffd9e ; /* bright yellow */ } If your card template is formatted like <div class=\"sentence\">{{ Sentence }}</div> : . sentence b { color : #fffd9e ; /* bright yellow */ /* if you want to make the word not bolded, un-comment the following */ /*font-weight: normal;*/ } Option 3: Custom div Yomichan Fields : {cloze-prefix}<span class=\"word-highlight\">{cloze-body}</span>{cloze-suffix} Anki Note CSS : . word-highlight { color : #fffd9e ; } Note I personally prefer using Option 2 (bold + styling) over a custom div because it makes editing the note easier. For example, if you want to edit the highlighted region, you only have to bold the desired region (say, with ctrl+b) instead of having to edit the raw HTML of the field (say, with ctrl+shift+x). See also: How to automatically highlight the targetted word within the sentence for already existing cards . Plain-Style Sentence Furigana \u00b6 Adds: {sentence-bolded-furigana-plain} This does the following: Generates plain style furigana on the sentence (e.g. \u300c \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e[\u306b\u307b\u3093\u3054]\u300d Bolds the added word To use this in Anki, add furigana: in front of the field within the template code. For example, if your field is SentenceReading , use {{furigana:SentenceReading}} .

However, generating furigana cannot be done within this addon on Android, as this is a PC add-on. Nonetheless, I recommend keeping AJT Furigana so furigana can be generated even after editing the sentence field. The {furigana} marker provided by default in Yomichan does not generate plain style furigana, which makes editing furigana more difficult in Anki.

The following scripts have the following changes: They all work with jp-mining-note by default. They have been rewritten so it can be presented in human-readable format right below the one-liner. The one-liners can be re-compiled from the source code at your own discretion (by building the documentation ). All the powershell source code can be found here . Screenshot and Clipboard Hotkey \u00b6 Features \u00b6 Adds the selected image to the note. This image is automatically shrunk (within the field viewer only, if you are using Anki versions 2.1.50+). Adds a tag to the note. The tag is exactly the window name of the current application. Sets the AdditionalNotes to the current clipboard. I use this for copying/pasting context (the lines surrounding the sentence). How-To \u00b6 Follow the steps for setting up the screenshot hotkey , and use this script in place of step 8's argument .

Unlike the above, these scripts are not meant to be used with audio or picture files. Rather, they are stand-alone scripts that modify the most recent cards added. These scripts are written in two formats: one that works automatically with your usual ShareX setup, and one in Python for cross-platform portability. Warning Do NOT view the card in the card browser when running any script, because if you do, the affected fields may not update. Close the card browser before running the scripts. However, you do not need to worry about this if you are running the python script with the --enable-gui-browse flag. How-To: Running with ShareX \u00b6 As shown above, ShareX has the ability to run custom user scripts. However, for ShareX to only run the script and do nothing else, the hotkey must be configured with steps shown below. Warning Depending on the popularity of these scripts, the ShareX versions may be deprecated in the future in favor of the easier to use/write/maintain Python versions. The only downside of using the Python script is that the user must have Python installed. Steps \u00b6 (TODO video) Under the main window, go to Hotkey Settings , and add a new hotkey. Click on the settings icon (of the newly added hotkey). In the Task tab (to the left): Set: Task to Screen capture \u2192 Capture active window Check Override After Capture Tasks ( ) Under After Capture , un-check everything, and check the following: Save Image to File Perform Actions Delete Locally In the Actions tab (to the left): Check Override Actions ( ) Uncheck all existing actions. Add a new action by clicking on Add . Set the following values of the action: File Path: C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe Argument: (the text in Sharex Script for the script you want to run) Note If you are adding multiple scripts with ShareX, instead of re-doing all of the steps above, you can instead duplicate the keybind, and simply set the Argument of the action to a different script. Explanation The reason that the After Capture settings include Save Image to File and Delete Locally is because without those settings, the Perform Actions section doesn't appear to run. Fortunately, the combination of Save Image to File and Delete Locally means the hotkey does the following: Saves the image file Runs the custom script Deletes the image file In other words, the image file is only temporarily created, and then deleted immediately after running the script. This effectively means that ShareX is only running the script whenever the keybind is used. How-To: Running with Python \u00b6 Warning If you use the Python script as is within the repository without copying it to a different directory, this script will be updated every time you update the repository. It's always good practice to not blindly run people's code on your computer. Make sure you trust the code , and double check after update! If you don't want to use ShareX, or you are not using Windows, you can simply run a python script with command line. # Your python version should be 3.8 or higher. # It may work for lower python versions, but I make no guarantee. python3 /path/to/jp-mining-note/tools/hotkey.py -f FUNCTION_NAME Examples (click here) # default python3 /path/to/jp-mining-note/tools/hotkey.py -f update_sentence # opens card browser automatically python3 /path/to/jp-mining-note/tools/hotkey.py -f update_sentence --enable-gui-browse If you want to use these as keybinds, I will leave it up to you to determine how to do that (as there are too many different setups and programs that people can use to create keybinds). However, some tips for ShareX and AutoKey are given below. Instructions for running Python scripts in ShareX If you want, you can even use the Python scripts with ShareX, so long as you have Python installed. To use Python with ShareX, follow all the steps (shown above ), until you set the action values. The command should be the DRIVE:\\PATH\\TO\\python.exe (instead of the path to powershell.exe ). The argument should be DRIVE:\\PATH\\TO\\jp-mining-note\\tools\\hotkey.py -f FUNCTION_NAME (instead of the large one-liner.) Instructions for AutoKey (Not AutoHotKey) If you are using AutoKey for Linux, it should be possible to do the following instead: Go to: Settings \u2192 Configure AutoKey \u2192 Script Engine \u2192 User Module file \u2192 (add the jp-mining-note/tools directory) Create a script type hotkey, Within the script, run any function thusly: import hotkey hotkey . FUNCTION_NAME () Example: import hotkey hotkey . update_sentence () Example with GUI: import hotkey hotkey . _browse_anki ( \"nid:1\" ) note_id = hotkey . update_sentence () hotkey . _browse_anki ( f \"nid: { note_id } \" ) Update Sentence with Clipboard \u00b6 Function Name : update_sentence This script updates the sentence with the current clipboard (while preserving the bolded word), and removes the SentenceReading field (of the newest note added). This script is useful when Yomichan's parsed sentence does not match the recorded audio. This is also useful for when Yomichan's word parser doesn't match the word itself (steps shown below). Note After running this script, you must manually generate the SentenceReading field if you want the furigana reading. Of course, this can be done in bulk at any point, as shown here . How-To: Fix incorrectly-bolded words (click here) As an example, The target word \u5e0c\u671b in the sentence \u300c\u5165\u90e8\u5e0c\u671b\u306a\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3051\u3069\u2026\u300d will be parsed by Yomichan as the following: \u5165\u90e8<b>\u5e0c\u671b\u306a</b>\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3051\u3069\u2026 Within the original popup, you can add two versions of the word by default: The one with JMdict only. Adding this word will add the sentence with incorrect bolding. The one with everything else other than JMdict. Adding this word will have the correct bold, but will be missing some definitions. To add the above sentence that solves both problems (no weird bold, and contains all definitions), do NOT add the word within the sentence. Instead, do the following: Highlight over the header word itself (or the word in the orthographic forms dictionary), and add that word instead. Demo (click here) Copy the desired sentence. Run this script. Note It is assumed that you have multiple popups enabled . How the bolded word is preserved (click here) The bolded word is preserved if the exact content within the bolded word is found within the clipboard, which should be almost always the case. For example, assume the added sentence is the following: \u3055\u3066\u306f < b > \u507d\u8005 </ b > \u3060\u306a\uff01 As long as the clipboard contains the word \u300c\u507d\u8005\u300d, then the bold is preserved. For example, the following clipboard contents will preserve the bold: \u304b\u308f\u3044\u3052\u306e\u3042\u308b\u5973\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u3002\u3055\u3066\u306f\u507d\u8005\u3060\u306a\uff01 ShareX Script (click here) -NoProfile -Command \"function Run-Json { param( $json_map ); $json = $json_map | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5; $data = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://127.0.0.1:8765 -Method Post -ContentType 'application/json; charset=UTF-8' -Body $json; return $data; }; $clipboard = (Get-Clipboard | where{$_ -ne ''}) -join ''; $added_notes = Run-Json @{ action = 'findNotes'; version = 6; params = @{ query = 'added:1'; } }; $sorted_list = $added_notes.result | Sort-Object -Descending {[Long]$_}; $curr_note_id = $sorted_list[0]; $curr_note_data = Run-Json @{ action = 'notesInfo'; version = 6; params = @{ notes = @($curr_note_id); } }; $curr_note_sent = $curr_note_data.result.fields.Sentence.value; $result_sent = ''; if ($curr_note_sent -match '<b>(?<bolded>.+)</b>') { $bolded = $matches['bolded']; $result_sent = $clipboard.replace($bolded, \\\"<b>$bolded</b>\\\"); } else { $result_sent = $clipboard; }; Run-Json @{ action = 'updateNoteFields'; version = 6; params = @{ note = @{ id = $curr_note_id; fields = @{ Sentence = $result_sent; SentenceReading = ''; } } } };\" Original ShareX Code (click here) # (common begin) function Run-Json { param ( $json_map ); $json = $json_map | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5 ; $data = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http :// 127 . 0 . 0 . 1 : 8765 -Method Post -ContentType ` 'application/json; charset=UTF-8' -Body $json ; return $data ; }; # (common end) $clipboard = ( Get-Clipboard | where { $_ -ne '' }) -join '' ; $added_notes = Run-Json @{ action = 'findNotes' ; version = 6 ; params = @{ query = 'added:1' ; } }; $sorted_list = $added_notes . result | Sort-Object -Descending { [Long] $_ }; $curr_note_id = $sorted_list [ 0 ]; $curr_note_data = Run-Json @{ action = 'notesInfo' ; version = 6 ; params = @{ notes = @( $curr_note_id ); } }; $curr_note_sent = $curr_note_data . result . fields .

This script is useful when Yomichan's parsed sentence does not match the recorded audio. This is also useful for when Yomichan's word parser doesn't match the word itself (steps shown below). Note After running this script, you must manually generate the SentenceReading field if you want the furigana reading. Of course, this can be done in bulk at any point, as shown here . How-To: Fix incorrectly-bolded words (click here) As an example, The target word \u5e0c\u671b in the sentence \u300c\u5165\u90e8\u5e0c\u671b\u306a\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3051\u3069\u2026\u300d will be parsed by Yomichan as the following: \u5165\u90e8<b>\u5e0c\u671b\u306a</b>\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3051\u3069\u2026 Within the original popup, you can add two versions of the word by default: The one with JMdict only. Adding this word will add the sentence with incorrect bolding. The one with everything else other than JMdict. Adding this word will have the correct bold, but will be missing some definitions. To add the above sentence that solves both problems (no weird bold, and contains all definitions), do NOT add the word within the sentence. Instead, do the following: Highlight over the header word itself (or the word in the orthographic forms dictionary), and add that word instead. Demo (click here) Copy the desired sentence. Run this script. Note It is assumed that you have multiple popups enabled . How the bolded word is preserved (click here) The bolded word is preserved if the exact content within the bolded word is found within the clipboard, which should be almost always the case. For example, assume the added sentence is the following: \u3055\u3066\u306f < b > \u507d\u8005 </ b > \u3060\u306a\uff01 As long as the clipboard contains the word \u300c\u507d\u8005\u300d, then the bold is preserved. For example, the following clipboard contents will preserve the bold: \u304b\u308f\u3044\u3052\u306e\u3042\u308b\u5973\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u3002\u3055\u3066\u306f\u507d\u8005\u3060\u306a\uff01 ShareX Script (click here) -NoProfile -Command \"function Run-Json { param( $json_map ); $json = $json_map | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5; $data = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://127.0.0.1:8765 -Method Post -ContentType 'application/json; charset=UTF-8' -Body $json; return $data; }; $clipboard = (Get-Clipboard | where{$_ -ne ''}) -join ''; $added_notes = Run-Json @{ action = 'findNotes'; version = 6; params = @{ query = 'added:1'; } }; $sorted_list = $added_notes.result | Sort-Object -Descending {[Long]$_}; $curr_note_id = $sorted_list[0]; $curr_note_data = Run-Json @{ action = 'notesInfo'; version = 6; params = @{ notes = @($curr_note_id); } }; $curr_note_sent = $curr_note_data.result.fields.Sentence.value; $result_sent = ''; if ($curr_note_sent -match '<b>(?<bolded>.+)</b>') { $bolded = $matches['bolded']; $result_sent = $clipboard.replace($bolded, \\\"<b>$bolded</b>\\\"); } else { $result_sent = $clipboard; }; Run-Json @{ action = 'updateNoteFields'; version = 6; params = @{ note = @{ id = $curr_note_id; fields = @{ Sentence = $result_sent; SentenceReading = ''; } } } };\" Original ShareX Code (click here) # (common begin) function Run-Json { param ( $json_map ); $json = $json_map | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5 ; $data = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http :// 127 . 0 . 0 . 1 : 8765 -Method Post -ContentType ` 'application/json; charset=UTF-8' -Body $json ; return $data ; }; # (common end) $clipboard = ( Get-Clipboard | where { $_ -ne '' }) -join '' ; $added_notes = Run-Json @{ action = 'findNotes' ; version = 6 ; params = @{ query = 'added:1' ; } }; $sorted_list = $added_notes . result | Sort-Object -Descending { [Long] $_ }; $curr_note_id = $sorted_list [ 0 ]; $curr_note_data = Run-Json @{ action = 'notesInfo' ; version = 6 ; params = @{ notes = @( $curr_note_id ); } }; $curr_note_sent = $curr_note_data . result . fields .

If you are working with modding the note, it is recommended that you create your own runtime options file, so you can edit the options at build time, while ensuring your runtime options file is up to date. Here is how you can create and use a custom runtime options file: Create the local runtime options file (e.g. user_jpmn_opts.jsonc ) cd config cp jpmn_opts.jsonc user_jpmn_opts.jsonc Change opts-path under config/config.py : \"opts-path\": \"user_jpmn_opts.jsonc\", (optional) Make the runtime options hard-coded to remove the file dependency during runtime, by changing the following setting in config/config.py : \"compile-options\": { \"hardcoded-runtime-options\": True, } Build and install the note as normal. Note If you are not using hard-coded runtime options and you have edited the contents of the local runtime options file, please run the installation script with --install-options to replace the existing options file in Anki's media folder. Field List Editing \u00b6 This section describes import PSAs on what you should you if you want to edit the fields of the note (i.e. adding, removing, renaming, and moving). Fields editing in this context refers to the fields that you can edit in the Fields (list) menu, found under (Main window) \u2192 Browse \u2192 Fields... . Note If you never plan on updating the note, you can safely modify the field list to your heart's content, and ignore the rest of this section. Installer details \u00b6 The installer, when detecting a higher version, attempts to find and apply any changes to the field list when necessary. These changes are specified under tools/note_changes.py . By default, the installer expects the field list to be completely un-changed after installation, and does many checks to verify this before and after installation. Do not remove fields \u00b6 One of the checks that the installer does is to ensure that all fields are present. This is a design choice to remove as many assumptions as possible, so that it is easier for the installer to update the note. Note This design choice may be changed in the future, but will likely remain until the end of the beta release. If you want to remove a field, the best alternative is to do the following: Move the field below the Comment field, so the field is out of your way. Whenever you decide to update the note to a new version, run the installation script with the --ignore-order flag. Do not rename fields \u00b6 There is currently no way to let the installer know that you renamed a field. Therefore, you should not rename fields at all, as this will cause the initial field list check to fail. If you are completely insistent on renaming a field, you must change all templates that uses the field to match your preferred field name. Note Similarily to the above, this may be changed in the future, but will likely remain until the end of the beta release. How to add & reorder fields \u00b6 If you want to add a field while preserving the existing field order upon updates, add the field under the Comment field.

See the webpack branch on Github if you want to see the work in progress. Overview \u00b6 Modules (not to be confused with regular javascript modules ) is a hybrid template/javascript system that allows code separation at the file level, but allows the javascript to be compiled into each template, rather than separate files. The biggest advantage of this over a monolithic system is that individual modules can be enabled, disabled, created, and modified at ease, all without editing the source files. Example (Hello World) \u00b6 The following will enable a the hello world module, which prints a \"Hello world!\" at the front of any card (as a warning on the info circle ). Under config/config.py , add \"example\" to enabled-modules . \"compile-options\": { \"allow-user-defined-modules\": True, \"enabled-modules\": [ ... \"customize-open-fields\", # Make sure a comma is here! \"example\" ] }, Under config/jpmn_opts.jsonc (or more preferably, your own options file specified under opts-path in config.py ), add the following: \"modules\": { \"customize-open-fields\": { ... }, // Make sure there is a comma here! \"example\": { \"enabled\": true } } Rebuild the note, and preview any card. The front side of any card should have a \"Hello world!\" warning, while the back side should remain normal. Quickstart \u00b6 If you want to get to inserting your own javascript as soon as possible, do the following: Follow the steps of the example above, and make sure the example module is working. Copy the example module into overrides/modules . This should result in the following file structure: overrides L modules L example L main.html L main.js From here, all you have to do is edit the main.js and main.html to your liking. Note The js module is of type JavascriptContainer , which is defined under tools/make.py . This interface allows you to define javascript within certain parts of a card, and restrict it to a certain subset of templates (sides and card types). Please see the aformentioned file to view the existing interface. Likewise, see the base javascript file ( src/jp-mining-note/base.js ) to view how the interface is used. If you want more detailed explanations on what has been happening up until this point, continue reading below. Enabling & Disabling Modules \u00b6 Modules can be easily enabled and disabled by modifying the enabled-modules option under config/config.py . Comment out any existing module, or add any modules you want to the list. Additionally, if you are using modules outside the default modules that come enabled with the note (including the example module), the allow-user-defined-modules option should be set to True . Modding Existing Modules \u00b6 Modules can be defined in the same style as the template overrides above. This means that if you want to edit a module, you can simply override the module files themselves by copying the module folder into overrides/modules folder. For example, if you want to override the auto-pitch-accent module, copy the auto-pitch-accent folder into overrides/module/auto-pitch-accent . Note In the quickstart, we did exactly this with the example module. Since the example module is completely overwritten by the user, the previous example module code is completely ignored. Creating More Modules \u00b6 The easiest way to create a new module is by copying the example folder, and renaming it to something different. This folder should be placed under overrides/modules under most cases. However, if you are looking to contribute to the project, place this under src/modules instead. Certain parts of the code should be renamed as well to avoid conflicts with the existing example module, including the MOD.id , import path, JPMNLogger constructor, and runtime option call ( utils.opt ). Of course, make sure all the renames are consistent. For example, all of the following should be the same: MOD.id module folder name JPMNLogger constructor argument Afterwards, make sure to add the module id to enabled-modules , and ensure that allow-user-defined-modules is set to True . If everything is done correctly, the note should include your custom module after the next build! Why not just separate the code with files? \u00b6 Short answer : In an attempt to keep the card as stable as possible between versions. Long answer : Anki specifically states this in its official documentation : Quote Javascript functionality is provided without any support or warranty. Many javascript-related things seem to behave strangely in Anki, which prevents the ability to separate files easily. Here have been the solutions I have tried before moving to this approach: Link an external script with the <script> tag There are two main problems with this approach: On older Anki versions (2.1.49 and below), all <script> tags loads asynchronously compared to each other. This means if any file must be ran before a file is loaded, then the script would fail. On versions 2.1.50 and above, it appears that Anki loads <script> tags synchronously. However, there is no guarantee that this will be the case for the future. Certain javascript in the main template has to be ran before loading in any file. This requirement exists for this note type due to the runtime-options file exists. The global JPMNOpts has to exist for any external files that uses runtime options to work. This can be fixed by importing the options separately for each file, but that naturally leads us to the examples shown in the following section. Regular imports within Javascript All other examples of importing without a separate <script src=\"...\"> requires asynchronous javascript features, which should be avoided as much as possible. Examples: < script > // https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/linking-to-external-javascript/1713 var injectScript = ( src ) => { return new Promise (( resolve , reject ) => { // a Promise is an asynchronous feature! const script = document . createElement ( 'script' ); script . src = src ; script . async = true ; script . onload = resolve ; script . onerror = reject ; document . head . appendChild ( script ); }); // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import // this import function is an asynchronous function! ( async () => { await import ( \"/modules/my-module.js\" ); // ... })(); </ script > <!-- type=\"module\" forces this entire script to run asynchronously! --> < script type = \"module\" > // for the `import` statement to work, the script must be of type=\"module\" // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import import { export1 } from \"module-name\" ; </ script > In conclusion, this is a design decision made after lots of trial and error when attempting to work with Anki's Javascript parser.

Supported Systems \u00b6 The most important step is to see if jp-mining-note (JPMN) works on your device. Card Creation (Yomichan) \u00b6 The card creation process requires a working instance of Yomichan, Anki-Connect, and Anki. By default, this works on PC (Windows, Mac, Linux), and the instructions shown will be for PC. However, with the proper setup, one can also create cards on the following platforms: Android (including Android based e-readers such as ONYX BOOX) Kindle (export to PC to create) I'm not aware of a workflow for iOS that works with Yomichan. Anki Desktop \u00b6 Primary support is given to the latest stable Anki versions (2.1.54+ & Qt6). Limited support will be given for older versions of Anki. With that being said, JPMN should work for Anki versions 2.1.49+. Mobile (AnkiDroid and AnkiMobile) \u00b6 Mobile support is slowly being worked on, but JPMN (on mobile) is currently not stable. Do not expect the note to work on mobile. Therefore, if you absolutely must use Anki on mobile, I recommend not using this note . (EDIT: If you are still interested in using the note on mobile, I recommend trying out the 0.12.0.0 beta ). AnkiWeb \u00b6 There is no support for AnkiWeb, and there are no plans to support AnkiWeb. Themes \u00b6 Both light mode and dark mode are supported. However, dark mode is recommended as the main theme of this note. Updating \u00b6 If you ever wish to update the note, this can only be done on PC, and cannot be done on mobile. The note does not auto-update; you must manually update the note. Theme & Design Principles \u00b6 Made for Japanese Learning \u00b6 The absolute fundamental goal of this note type is to make learning Japanese easier . Every feature you see is to simply make this learning process easier and smoother. Minimalistic Design \u00b6 This note is visually designed to be minimalistic because the fundamental goal is to learn Japanese, not to have eye catching graphics. Minimal Dependencies \u00b6 The only fundamental dependencies are Yomichan (to create the note) and the Anki-Connect add-on (to export the note from Yomichan , update the note, and for certain features to work within the note). Absolutely nothing else is required. This helps with maintaining stability across various Anki versions. Modularized, Customizable & Extendable \u00b6 This project ships with built-in tools to easily disable/enable features, or even completely remove them from the base template via compile-time options . Additionally, there are many built-in ways to extend the note to suit your exact needs. Free & Open Source \u00b6 Everything here, including the documentation itself, is completely free and open source, licensed under MIT . Rest easy knowing you will keep full ownership of your note, forever. Alternatives \u00b6 There are many, many Anki templates out there in the wild. The following page is my attempt to assemble together some of the the popular and/or interesting card templates. Setup \u00b6 Excited to take this note on a whirl?

Installing jp-mining-note \u00b6 There are two ways of installing the note: Option 1: The Automatic Way (click here) If you know what git and python is, here's all you have to do: Windows MacOS & Linux git clone \"https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jp-mining-note.git\" cd jp-mining-note : : Ensure you have Anki open, and with anki-connect running : : Also ensure that you have python 3.10+ installed. : : It *MAY* work with lower versions of python, but I make no such guarantee. ;) python tools\\install.py git clone \"https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jp-mining-note.git\" cd jp-mining-note # Ensure you have Anki open, and with anki-connect running # Also ensure that you have python 3.10+ installed. # It *MAY* work with lower versions of python, but I make no such guarantee. ;) # You may have to use `python3` instead of `python`. python tools/install.py The above does the following: Installs the latest stable version of the note Installs the fonts required for the note If the above made no sense to you, or you just want to install this normally, see the second option below. Option 2: The Manual Way (click here) Go to the releases page and download the cards from the latest release. You should download the {version}-jpmn_example_cards.apkg file. After you download the cards, import them by navigating to Anki by doing the following: File (top left corner) \u2192 Import... By default, the custom fonts do not come with the .apkg file. To install these fonts, head over to this repository's media folder and download the 4 .otf files. Move the .otf files into the media folder of your profile ( Anki2/PROFILENAME/collections.media ). Verifying the Note Works \u00b6 You should see a deck JPMN-Examples in your collection. View one of the cards and make sure the card looks similar to the one below: Dark Theme Light Theme Please check the following in particular: The fonts should match with the above example. If the fonts don't match, try restarting Anki. If the fonts still don't match, the note was likely installed with \"Option 2: The Manual Way\". Please verify you manually installed the fonts and placed them in the correct folder (see steps 3 and 4). Notice how at the top left corner, the info circle (the \"i\" encased within the circle) is the default grey color. If this circle is red or orange, there may be something wrong with the template. Please see this section for basic troubleshooting. Clicking on the image to zoom should work out of the box. Kanji hover may not work yet. If it doesn't work, read the Anki-Connect setup instructions on the next page. If the image suddenly appears without a zoom animation, then you must enable animations on Anki . If the furigana on your card seems to appear higher above the kanji compared to the picture, see the Fix Ruby Positioning option.

Click here see how to setup Anki!","title":"Anki Setup"},{"location":"setupanki/","text":"New to Anki? \u00b6 If you have never used Anki before, I recommend using fsrs4anki to get more optimized settings than the default settings. That article showcases only one way of setting up Anki's settings for language learning. Feel free to view some other examples here . Updating Anki \u00b6 It is highly recommended that you are using the latest (stable) Anki version (or as close as you can get to the latest Anki version). This includes using the Qt6 version instead of Qt5 if possible. Using the latest version of Anki is recommended for the following reasons: The note is primarily tested and maintained on the latest versions of Anki. There are a few minor but known bugs that this note type has with older Anki versions. These bugs do not exist in newer Anki versions. Worst case scenario, if any essential add-ons no longer work, you can always downgrade back to a previous version. If you aren't upgrading Anki from an older version, you can skip the rest of this section. Tips on Updating Anki (click here) Official Documentation The official documentation on how to install and upgrade Anki is shown below: Windows \u30fb MacOS \u30fb Linux Note that for all three, there are additional sections in the table of contents to the left that could be helpful. Add-ons Breaking If an add-on (that worked in a previous version of Anki) no longer works, you have a few options you can try: As a sanity check, click the Check for Updates button on Anki's Addons window. Check that the add-on supports the current version of Anki in the official AnkiWeb page. If the page says that the current Anki version is supported, try reinstalling it again from AnkiWeb. Occasionally, the Check for Updates button doesn't properly work, so this method ensures that your addon is actually updated. Enable Animations (2.1.61 - 2.1.63) \u00b6 If you are using Anki versions 2.1.61, 2.1.62 or 2.1.63, animations are disabled by default. The note works best with animations enabled. To enable animations, head over to: Tools \u2192 Preferences \u2192 Appearance \u2192 Reduce Motion \u2192 (unchecked) Note Starting Anki 2.1.64, Reduce Motion no longer affects animations within templates. 1 Dark Mode \u00b6 Although light mode is supported, the recommended theme for this note is dark mode. With that being said, changing the theme is completely optional. The note automatically adjusts according to Anki's theme. To change Anki's theme, head over to: Tools \u2192 Preferences \u2192 Basic \u2192 Theme (dropdown) Note The note's theme currently cannot be forced to be a particular theme without changing Anki's settings. Anki Add-ons \u00b6 There are certain add-ons that must be installed for this note type to work. Conflicting Add-ons \u00b6 There are no conflicting add-ons, since I'm not aware of any currently. Let me know if you find one! Downloading Add-ons \u00b6 To download an add-on, copy the add-on's code, and navigate to the following to paste the code: Tools \u2192 Add-ons \u2192 Get Add-ons... Required Add-ons \u00b6 Anki-Connect \u00b6 Code: 2055492159 Required for Yomichan and most other Anki-related automated tasks to work. I use the default config that comes with the add-on. Note for Anki versions 2.1.49 and below Anki versions 2.1.49 and below require a hack to the Anki-Connect config for certain features within the card to work. In particular, Anki-Connect is used for the \"Kanji Hover\" feature and the \"Open Fields on New Card\" feature. To make those features work, add \"null\" to the webCorsOriginList list in the Anki-Connect config file. An example of how the config should look is shown below: \"webCorsOriginList\": [ \"http://localhost\", \"null\" ] Of course, this isn't very safe and it is highly recommended that you upgrade Anki to avoid this problem. If you aren't interested in those features, you can skip this step and disable them in the runtime options . Optional Add-ons \u00b6 These are a set of optional, but useful add-ons that can easily work with the card. If this is your first time here, I recommend skimming through the descriptions and choosing the add-ons that seem appealing for you. Note Make sure to head over to the final steps section afterwards! CSS Injector \u00b6 Code: 181103283 I strongly recommend using this, because if you don't use this, the fields within the Anki field editor won't have certain stylizations that makes the field actually interpretable. There are two ways of using css injector with this note type: Option 1: Automatically updates with the card (recommended) Windows MacOS Linux As a preliminary step, you will have to remove the empty field.css and editor.css files that comes with the add-on. That can be done through command line (below), or you can simply navigate to the Anki2/addons21/181103283/user_files folder (within the addons folder ) and delete both css files. : : be sure to change USERNAME to your computer username! del \"C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Anki2\\addons21\\181103283\\user_files\\field.css\" del \"C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Anki2\\addons21\\181103283\\user_files\\editor.css\" Afterwards, open command prompt with elevated permissions. Note Be sure to open command prompt, and not PowerShell. If you've never used command prompt before, see this . With command prompt opened, run the following command: : : be sure to change USERNAME to your computer username and PROFILENAME to your Anki profile. : : There are **two** USERNAME's to replace, and **one** PROFILENAME to replace : : in the commands below. : : Make sure to replace all the fields! mklink \"C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Anki2\\addons21\\181103283\\user_files\\field.css\" \"C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Anki2\\PROFILENAME\\collection.media\\_field.css\" mklink \"C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Anki2\\addons21\\181103283\\user_files\\editor.css\" \"C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Anki2\\PROFILENAME\\collection.media\\_editor.css\" As a preliminary step, you will have to remove the empty field.css and editor.css files that comes with the add-on. That can be done through command line (below), or you can simply navigate to the Anki2/addons21/181103283/user_files folder (within the addons folder ) and delete both css files. rm \" $HOME /Library/Application Support/Anki2/addons21/181103283/user_files/field.css\" rm \" $HOME /Library/Application Support/Anki2/addons21/181103283/user_files/editor.css\" Afterwards, run the following command: # be sure to change `PROFILENAME` to your Anki profile ln -s \" $HOME /Library/Application Support/Anki2/PROFILENAME/collection.media/_field.css\" \" $HOME /Library/Application Support/Anki2/addons21/181103283/user_files/field.css\" ln -s \" $HOME /Library/Application Support/Anki2/PROFILENAME/collection.media/_editor.css\" \" $HOME /Library/Application Support/Anki2/addons21/181103283/user_files/editor.css\" As a preliminary step, you will have to remove the empty field.css and editor.css files that comes with the add-on. That can be done through command line (below), or you can simply navigate to the Anki2/addons21/181103283/user_files folder (within the addons folder ) and delete both css files. rm \" $HOME /.local/share/Anki2/addons21/181103283/user_files/field.css\" rm \" $HOME /.local/share/Anki2/addons21/181103283/user_files/editor.css\" Afterwards, run the following command: # be sure to change `PROFILENAME` to your Anki profile ln -s \" $HOME /.local/share/Anki2/PROFILENAME/collection.media/_field.css\" \" $HOME /.local/share/Anki2/addons21/181103283/user_files/field.css\" ln -s \" $HOME /.local/share/Anki2/PROFILENAME/collection.media/_editor.css\" \" $HOME /.local/share/Anki2/addons21/181103283/user_files/editor.css\" Option 2: Manually without respecting updates Navigate to css injector addon folder ( Anki2/addons21/181103283/user_files ) Remove the existing field.css and editor.css files Copy the _field.css file and _editor.css file (found under your profile's media folder ) into the css injector add-on directory. Rename _field.css to field.css . Rename _editor.css to editor.css . Note If either of the two css files ever update, you will have to manually copy and rename the file again. AJT Japanese \u00b6 Code: 1344485230 Warning As of writing this (2023/04/28), AJT Japanese is only guaranteed to work on Anki versions 2.1.60 and above, because it is no longer maintained on previous versions. If you are using an older version of Anki, please update Anki or do not use this add-on. This is an add-on that automatically adds furigana and pitch accents to cards upon Yomichan card creation. Previously known as AJT Furigana , and now comes packaged with AJT Pitch Accent . If this add-on is not used, then the following features will be missing: Automatically generated furigana Devoiced and nasal information to pitch accents Less coverage on pitch accents If your Yomichan pitch accent dictionaries did not contain any pitch accent info for the word but the add-on does, then it will use the add-on data. This will likely happen for expressions containing more than one word. Fortunately, AJT Japanese can usually detect the existence of multiple words, and add the pitch accent for each individual word.

Without this, the default styles will look like the word you see in the official add-on page. The Add pitch accent number and Add furigana for word profiles are not used. In order to disable them, the note type is set to AJT_JAPANESE_IGNORE_PROFILE , which only matches note types containing the string AJT_JAPANESE_IGNORE_PROFILE . It is very unlikely that your Anki notes will unintentionally contain this string. This makes the separators behave like the old version, and has to be changed to this for the default config of jp-mining-note to work. This is set to a high number in order for many pitch accents to be displayed for long expressions. This is fine because the pitch accent display is usually overwritten by the PAPositions field, so it's rare to see the AJTWordPitch field results anyways. Additionally, a higher number increases the sample size for the internal auto-pitch-accent module, to better search for devoiced and nasal markers. (Optional) This is to restrict the generated furigana to only show one reading. Feel free to leave this as the default ( 3 ). (Optional) I personally have the buttons removed because I don't want it to clutter up the editor toolbar. Feel free to have these enabled. (Optional) These are disabled because it slows down Anki's startup time. Additionally, the note does not use this feature. If you want to use this feature, feel free to enable these. Additional Info \u00b6 Furigana generation is occasionally incorrect, so if you plan on using furigana regularly, you should double-check the readings to make sure they are correct. JapaneseSupport v.s. AJT Japanese (Furigana) If you use JapaneseSupport , bolded words and other styles within a field are not transferred over from the original field to the reading field. Additionally, JapaneseSupport does not have an option to automatically add the reading upon card creation. AJT Japanese supports both of those of those features. Final Steps: After Installing Add-ons \u00b6 After the above setup, make sure to restart Anki for the add-ons and config changes to take effect. If the css injector add-on is installed correctly, your Anki field editor should now have color! Additionally, now that Anki-Connect is installed, kanji hover should also be functioning. Hover over a kanji within the word reading to make sure that a popup appears. In particular, the \u8005 kanji in the example \u507d\u8005 and \u4e0d\u5be9\u8005 cards should point to each other. Note Hovering over the other kanjis will display a Kanji not found. message, because the template only searches for kanjis within existing jp-mining-note cards. If you wish to see usages of the kanji within words outside of your deck, I highly recommend using Marv's JPDB Kanji Yomichan Dictionary . Transfer Existing Notes \u00b6 If you wish to transfer existing cards into this note type (say, to make kanji hover work on existing cards), please see this page . Updating the Note \u00b6 If you wish to update the note, follow the steps in this page . This note does not auto-update. This should keep your setup stable, as long as you do not update Anki. When updating Anki, don't forget to check if there is a new version of this note available, because this note should update along with Anki. Setting up Yomichan \u00b6 Of course, you can have an Anki template, but what's the point of it if you can't make cards with it? We will use Yomichan to create these cards.

Instead of repeating what others have already said, those programs and guides will be linked. If you are looking to setup jp-mining-note, see this page instead. Note If you already have a sentence mining workflow, you can likely skip to this section . Troubleshooting & Support \u00b6 If you are having troubles with any of the guides or programs below, I unfortunately will not be able to provide very detailed support. Instead, I would recommend that you contact the creators of the guides / programs, or the communities surrounding said guides / programs. Additionally, the guides listed here usually do not use JPMN, and instead link to other note types. This shouldn't be an issue as long as you change the appropriate the field names. Getting the Text to Create the Cards \u00b6 I use a texthooker setup, which is able to extract subtitles or text into the browser. Once the text is on the browser, you can use Yomichan to select the word and create the Anki card (by clicking on the green plus button). The standard texthooker setup works for most games, and any show with subtitle files. Texthooker: Websocket based \u00b6 These pages display the hooked content, where the hooked content is communicated via Websockets. Websocket based texthookers are better than the classic clipboard-based texthookers in almost every aspect: They are generally faster and more reliable. They do not flood your clipboard. They do not require an extension that constantly polls the clipboard. However, it requires more specialized coordination between programs. Resources (click here) Renji's Texthooker Page (recommended) I use these settings to make the text more compressed. This texthooker page comes with built in support for both websockets and clipboard inserter plugins. exSTATic (recommended for stats lovers) Its primary use is for automatic stats collection and visualizing said statistics. Integrates seamlessly with many workflows. Uses a custom texthooker page, which connects with Textractor with its own custom extension. A video installation guide is available on the project's README page. Supported Workflows: Textractor with textractor-websocket or TextractorSender mpv with mpv_websocket Legacy Resources (click here) These resources are considered legacy, and I highly recommend using the standard resources above in favor of these.

Getting Images & Sentence Audio Manually \u00b6 Sometimes, there is no easy way to get the image and sentence audio other than with a screen recorder. The primary example for this is game-like content. Here are the two popular approaches to automatically adding the image and sentence audio: ShareX (Windows) ShareX Windows media recorder which can both take screenshots and record audio. Personally tested. Guides: stegatxins0's mining guide: ShareX (recommended) The scripts written here works by default with this note. These scripts are meant used with stegatxins0's setup.

This script-opts folder does not exist by default. You will likely have to create the folder. Additionally, be sure to restart MPV after changing the config to apply the changes. A common issue with mpvacious is that the SentenceReading field may differ from the Sentence field, say, if you export multiple subtitles into one card. See the FAQ on how to fix it. To create cards with mpvacious, first add a card from Yomichan (usually via a texthooker), and then press ctrl + m in mpv. asbplayer \u00b6 To use asbplayer, add the card with Yomichan, and then update the created note with asbplayer. I recommend filling out the following fields as follows: asbplayer fields (click here) asbplayer field JPMN field Sentence Field Sentence Definition Field Word Field Audio Field SentenceAudio Image Field Picture Source Field AdditionalNotes URL Field AdditionalNotes Note Chances are that you are using subtitles. However, if you are not using subtitles, it is fine to keep the Sentence Field empty.

Note Anything field marked with * are binary fields, and should be configured to each user's personal preferences. To change the default value of any of the fields, simply fill the field in within the aforementioned Anki card format... section. For example, if you want the card to be a sentence card by default, fill the IsSentenceCard field here. The custom markers like {jpmn-primary-definition} is not provided by Yomichan by default. See the section below to make these markers usable. Yomichan Templates \u00b6 Yomichan supports user inserted template code that allows the automatic separation of bilingual and monolingual dictionary definitions, custom stylization, etc. This note type makes heavy use of these custom templates. To make the new markers usable, do the following: Navigate to Yomichan Settings. Make sure that advanced settings are turned on (bottom left corner). Go to the Anki section Select Configure Anki card templates... If you have existing template code already, I highly recommend resetting the templates (bottom right corner, red button) unless you know exactly what you are doing. After resetting the templates, without removing any of the existing template code, add the following template code as follows: Copy and paste the code below to the top of the default Yomichan template code: Click here to show the template code to copy. {{ ~! ~ }} {{ ~! =================== = jp-mining-note handlebars ==================== = ~ }} {{ ~! v1.0.1 ~ }} {{ ~! ~ }} {{ ~! https : //aquafina-water-bottle.github.io/jp-mining-note/ ~ }} {{ ~! ------------------------------------------------------- ~ }} {{ ~! =============== = Dictionary Categorization Options ================ = ~ }} {{ ~! valid values : \"bilingual\" , \"monolingual\" ~ }} {{ ~set \"opt-first-definition-type\" \"bilingual\" ~ }} {{ ~! matches most JMdict dictionaries , \u65b0\u548c\u82f1 and \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u6587\u6cd5\u8f9e\u5178 (\u5168\u96c6) ~ }} {{ ~#set \"bilingual-dict-regex\" ~ }} ^(([Jj][Mm][Dd]ict)(?!

Notably, the picture and sentence audio is missing. Outside of that, there are some final settings you can adjust within the Yomichan templates if the card doesn't look quite right. Yomichan Templates Options Summary \u00b6 Monolingual Definition \u00b6 If you want the first definition you see (the PrimaryDefinition field) to be monolingual, change the following line at the top of the templates code: {{ ~#set \"opt-first-definition-type\" \"bilingual\" }}{{ /set~ }} to {{ ~#set \"opt-first-definition-type\" \"monolingual\" }}{{ /set~ }} Additionally, a common thing that people want to do with monolingual dictionaries is to remove the first line of the definition, because it may contain extra info that the user does not want. See here to do exactly that. Note If you are using monolingual dictionaries, on your first few cards, please check that your dictionaries are in the expected places. Extra bilingual definitions should be under Secondary Definition , and extra monolingual definitions should be under Extra Definitions . If your dictionaries are ending up in the wrong sections, then it is likely a problem with how the template code categorizes the dictionaries. See here for more info. Selected Text as the Definition \u00b6 If you want to select the text to use instead of the definition, simply set opt-selection-text-enabled to true . By default, this enable the following behavior: If nothing is selected, then the first dictionary is chosen just like normal. If a dictionary is selected, then that dictionary will replace the first definition. If a section of text is selected, then that dictionary will replace the first definition. Additionally, that section of text will be highlighted (bolded). Note Selecting parts of a definition to bold the text does not always work, especially when used across text with formatting or newlines. See this for more details. With this being said, selecting the dictionary should always work. Additional Instructions for Other Platforms \u00b6 Outside of creating cards on the PC, there are some other platforms that one can create cards from. Android Setup \u00b6 Warning Actually using JPMN on mobile devices (e.g. for reviewing), is currently not stable. This simply shows how to make the cards on Android. If you wish to add cards on Android, use AnkiconnectAndroid and follow the instructions on the AnkiconnectAndroid's README page. It might help to export a copy of Yomichan settings from your PC and import said settings on Android, instead of re-doing all of the steps on Android. Note Occasionally, importing your Yomichan settings from the PC may lead to AnkiconnectAndroid not working. If AnkiconnectAndroid doesn't work after going through the entire README, try resetting your Yomichan settings on Android and starting from scratch. Note There is currently no way to automatically add an image (e.g. a screenshot) automatically. Images must be added manually within AnkiDroid. Although screenshots cannot be added automatically, the runtime options supports automatically adding images based off of tags. See here for more info. Kindle Setup \u00b6 One can use something like ann2html to export a Yomichan-able HTML file based on the Kindle's vocabulary builder. This allows you to add the cards through Yomichan on the PC. Enjoy your new one-click cards! \u00b6 If you've made it this far, then congratulations! Most fields of the cards have been automatically filled out, just from Yomichan alone! This concludes the setup process for creating cards with Yomichan. From here, you likely fall under one of the two categories below: I'm new to sentence mining. If you're new to sentence mining, there are likely some things things that you would like to set up. These include: Getting the actual text to use Yomichan on. Getting the pictures and/or sentence audio from the media into the card. Head over to the Setup: Everything Else page to see exactly that. I already have a sentence mining workflow. If you have a workflow already setup, you may have to do some minor tweaks to your current workflow to match the new field names. For example, the exporting sentence audio and picture fields may be different compared to your previous card. Other than that, you are completely finished with the setup process! Note See Setup: Everything Else (Notes on Various Programs) for specific tips on a select few programs.","title":"Setup: Yomichan"},{"location":"setupyomichan/#overview","text":"Yomichan is the main program that will create the cards.

If you are using Firefox, ensure that your Yomichan version is indeed the latest version, by clicking on the Yomichan icon and clicking on the question mark.

Summary \u00b6 Most of the user interface is already shown off in the GUI demo , and I would recommend watching it before continuing. However, to dispell any mysteries, here is a fully annotated summary of the user interface. Additional information on some parts of the UI is stated below. Keybinds \u00b6 This note ships with some keybinds to do basic actions. Keybind What it does p Play sentence audio w Play word audio 8 Toggles Secondary Definition field 9 Toggles Additional Notes field 0 Toggles Extra Definitions field [ Toggles Extra Info field See the runtime options if you would like to edit / disable any keybind, and/or to view the full list of keybinds. Info Circle \u00b6 Default Error Warning Leech On hover, the info circle on the top left corner just shows some basic info. However, it also serves as a notification system to the user, when it has a color. This should only appear when some javascript code fails. In other words, this should not appear under normal circumstances. If you get this without modifying the note in any way, please see this section for basic troubleshooting. This serves to warn the user about something. It can appear without completely breaking the functionality of the card. In other words, you can choose to ignore it. When the card is a leech, the circle is highlighted yellow (or blue in light mode) to indicate that it is a leech. This is only shown on the back side of the card. Locking the Info Circle \u00b6 New in version 0.10.3.0 (latest version: 0.11.0.4 ) You can toggle (click on) the info circle to lock the tooltip in place. This may be useful for copying/pasting errors and other debugging purposes. Kanji Hover \u00b6 Kanji hover shows you if you have seen the kanji in previous cards or not. This is useful if you want to check whether you have seen the reading in a previous card, to differentiate between similar kanjis, etc. By default, it searches for the kanji within the \"Word\" field, within \"JP Mining Note\" types. Various Details: You may have noticed that some results are greyed out. These represent words from cards that have not been reviewed yet. Conversely, as non-greyed out results come from cards that you have already reviewed, they should represent words that you already know. Pitch accents are shown when you hover over a particular word within the tooltip. You can change this to always be shown in the runtime options . You can click on the word to open the specified card within Anki's card browser. See here for information on how the examples are chosen, and how to customize it. Related Programs (click here) Cade's Kanji Hover Hover over a kanji to see its readings, meanings (english), and other info. This does not show example words from other cards. My implmentation of kanji hover was heavily inspired by this. Hanzi Web for Anki The end result of this is to this note's implementation of kanji-hover, in the sense that it is used to see kanjis that have been used in other notes. However, it differs primarily in the fact that all the information must be mass-generated. This indeed has several advantages, such as being able to use the infomation on Android, where Anki-Connect isn't full supported. KanjiEater's Kanji Connections Ability to show kanjis with heisig's RTK keywords, as well as related vocabulary. Similar to Hanzi Web for Anki. Warning None of the above will work with jp-mining-note by default. In fact, it's almost guaranteed that Cade's Kanji Hover will conflict with this note's kanji hover ability. Word Indicators \u00b6 New in version 0.11.0.0 (latest version: 0.11.0.4 ) Indicators will be shown to the top-left of the reading when similar words in your deck are found. The indicators are as follows: \u540c (short for \u540c\u3058) indicates that the card is a duplicate. \u8aad (short for \u8aad\u307f\u65b9) indicates that there are other card(s) with the same reading (ignoring pitch accent). In Japanese, these words are \u540c\u97f3\u7570\u7fa9\u8a9e. I consider this the most useful of the three. \u6f22 (short for \u6f22\u5b57) indicates that there are other card(s) with the same kanji, but different reading. As you can see from the above, the query ignores pitch accent. The word \u81ea\u8eab is still shown, despite having a different pitch accent compared to \u5730\u9707. Note This indicator will be yellow (or blue on light mode) for new cards only. After the first review, the indicator will be the same color as the default info circle (grey). The tooltip behaves very similarly properties to Kanji hover's tooltip: New cards are greyed out. You can click on words to open them in Anki's card browser. Pitch accent is shown without requiring the user to hover over the word by default. This is different from Kanji hover's tooltip. See here for information on how the examples are chosen, and how to customize it. Images & Pitch Accent \u00b6 See the Images page for information on the following: Blurring images Specifying default images Automatically formatting pictures within the definition See the Pitch Accent page for information on the following: Pitch accent notation Automatic pitch accent coloring How to override the pitch accent of any word External Links \u00b6 New in version 0.10.3.0 (latest version: 0.11.0.4 ) External links are shown as icons in the Extra Info collapsable field by default. By default, hovering over them will show the url. Click on the desired icon to visit to the desired site. See also: UI Customization (External Links) . Automatic Word Highlighting \u00b6 Warning New as of version 0.11.1.0 . This version is currently bleeding edge , so this feature cannot be used unless you compile the templates from the dev branch. Usually, the word within the sentence is already bolded by Yomichan. However, there are some cases where the word within the sentence may not be bold, such as when external programs update the Sentence field, or if you are using imported cards. By default, the note attempts to highlight the word within the sentence. With that being said, it is not uncommon that the automatic highlighting fails to highlight the full word. For example, verb and i-adj. conjugations are not highlighted whatsoever. In order to keep the javascript lightweight, any improper highlighting is considered as expected behavior , and will not be changed or fixed. I recommend manually bolding the word if the word is incorrectly highlighted. Examples (click here) Any text in red is not highlighted automatically. They are considered as examples of when automatic highlighting doesn't work.

As there are many examples that you likely won't use, I recommend quickly skimming through this page to see if there is anything you would like your note to do. Note If you want to change something for a card-per-card basis, see the Field Reference page. These customizations make heavy use of runtime options and custom CSS . Fix Ruby Positioning (for legacy Anki versions) \u00b6 New in version 0.11.0.0 (latest version: 0.11.0.4 ) If the furigana appears higher than normal on your card, the following runtime option serves as a quick fix to lower the furigana: { \"fix-ruby-positioning\" : ... } See the pictures below to compare between furigana positions. Higher than Normal Quick Fix Normal Why this happens \u00b6 There are a few reasons why this can happen: Your Anki version is 2.1.49 or below. Your Anki version is 2.1.50 and above, but using the older Qt5 version. You are using AnkiMobile. If you have this issue with the desktop version of Anki, it is recommended that you update a version with Qt6 support. This will allow the furigana to behave as expected. If you are unable to do that for any reason, or you are using AnkiMobile, this option serves as a quick but imperfect fix to make the furigana lower. This fix is imperfect because it adds even more spacing to the left and right than normal if the furigana text is too long. External Links \u00b6 External links in primary definition \u00b6 New in version 0.11.0.0 (latest version: 0.11.0.4 ) External links usually appear in the \"Extra Info\" section. If you wish to have the external links to be on the primary definition section, set external-links-position to \"Primary Definition\" in the compile-time options . Customize external links \u00b6 New in version 0.10.3.0 (latest version: 0.11.0.4 ) Custom external links can be specified under the external-links section in the compile-time options . Creating external links is self explanatory and is explained further in the config file. Additionally, some commented-out examples are provided within the file. Remove all external links (click here) If you want to remove all external links, set external-links to {} in the compile-time options . For example: \"external-links\": {}, Icons with multiple text characters (click here) When using text instead of a picture, it is recommended that you use single characters (e.g. one kanji) to represent the icon. However, in the cases where you want to use more characters, the default CSS rules causes the icon will use the minimum amount of space, which may mis-aligned the surrounding icons. Using the custom SCSS , you can specify the amount of space it takes (in terms of number of icons): @use \"../base/common\" as common ; .glossary__external-links a [ data-details = \"DICTIONARY_ID\" ] { // (1)! width : common .maxWidthForXIcons ( 2 ); } The DICTIONARY_ID are the key values of external-links . For example, the id of the jpdb.io entry below is exactly jpdb.io . \"jpdb.io\" : { \"icon-type\" : \"image\" , \"icon-image-light\" : \"_icon_jpdb_lightmode.png\" , \"icon-image-dark\" : \"_icon_jpdb_darkmode.png\" , \"url\" : \"https://jpdb.io/search?q={{text:Word}}\" } Warning This SCSS code is NOT CSS . This cannot be added directly to the template's style sheet in Anki. Please see the link above to see how to use custom SCSS. An example of this can be found in src/scss/dictionaries/style.scss Adjusting Zoom \u00b6 You can increase (or decrease) the size of the card, (without affecting any of Anki's GUI) with custom CSS . Instructions (click here) Under extra/style.scss , add the following code: : root { /* Times 1.1 of the original size. * If you want to make the note smaller, use a value below 1, like 0.9. */ --zoom : 1.1 ; } Limiting number of frequencies \u00b6 This CSS allows you to limit the number of frequencies shown at the top right corner. Instructions (click here) Under extra/style.scss , add the following code: /* max 5 frequencies shown */ . frequencies div . frequencies__group : nth-child ( n + 6 ) { display : none ; } (Optional) Under extra/field.scss , add the following code: /* max 5 frequencies shown */ anki-editable [ field = \"FrequenciesStylized\" ] div . frequencies__group : nth-child ( n + 6 ) { color : var ( --text-color--3 ); } This will grey out the frequencies past the 5th frequency in the editor. TODO: ONLY VERSION 0.11.1.0 and over, NOT RELEASED YET By default, a maximum of 4 frequencies are shown. Any more frequency list entries will appear in a dropdown arrow to the right of the frequencies. You can edit the following runtime option to adjust this number: { \"modules\" : { \"freq-utils\" : { \"max\" : 4 } } } Changing the display language \u00b6 Warning New as of version 0.11.1.0 . This version is currently bleeding edge , so this feature cannot be used unless you compile the templates from the dev branch. By default, the display language is in English. Currently, Japanese and English are supported as display languages. To change the display language (say, to Japanese), use the following compile-time option : \"display-languages\": [\"jp\", \"en\"], Note Currently, only some text is supported. This means that various tooltips on hover, warning messages, etc. will still be in English. SentenceReading Furigana Options \u00b6 By default, the furigana for the full sentence (on the back side of the card) is shown on hover. The following options change how the furigana is displayed. SentenceReading: When to show furigana \u00b6 Warning New as of version 0.11.1.0 . This version is currently bleeding edge , so this feature cannot be used unless you compile the templates from the dev branch. By default, furigana is shown on hover. This can be changed to only be shown on click, or always/never shown. On click On hover (default) Always revealed Never revealed TODO gif: show on click Instructions (click here) Change the following compile-time option : \"full-sentence-ruby\" : { \"display-mode\" : \"click\" , } This is commonly paired with the hide furigana spacing option, so furigana does not impede with the sentence whatsoever until toggled. TODO gif: show on hover This is the default behavior. Instructions (click here) Change the following compile-time option : \"full-sentence-ruby\" : { \"display-mode\" : \"hover\" , } TODO gif: static with mouseover This is not recommended, because you should not be relying on furigana to understand Japanese. Instructions (click here) Change the following compile-time option : \"full-sentence-ruby\" : { \"display-mode\" : \"always\" , } TODO gif: static with mouseover If you are looking to not see furigana at all, feel free to use this option. However, I personally recommend toggling on click instead of removing furigana completely. Instructions (click here) Change the following compile-time option : \"full-sentence-ruby\" : { \"display-mode\" : \"never\" , } SentenceReading: Hide spacing \u00b6 Warning New as of version 0.11.1.0 . This version is currently bleeding edge , so this feature cannot be used unless you compile the templates from the dev branch. Furigana that extends past the length of the kanji will add additional spacing around the kanjis, which may be unpleasant to look at. One solution to this is to simply hide the spacing until hover or click. This has the unintentional consequence where kanjis can potentionally change position, or overflow into the next line. There is also a possibility that the entire sentence shifts over a bit to the left due to (what I think is a) chromium based bug 1 . Hide Spacing Hide spacing with no transition Keep spacing (default) TODO img Instructions (click here) Change the following compile-time options : \"full-sentence-ruby\" : { \"fill-mode\" : \"font-size\" , \"fill-mode-font-size-transition\" : True , } TODO img Instructions (click here) Change the following compile-time options : \"full-sentence-ruby\" : { \"fill-mode\" : \"font-size\" , \"fill-mode-font-size-transition\" : False , } TODO img This is the default behavior. Instructions (click here) Change the following compile-time option : \"full-sentence-ruby\" : { \"fill-mode\" : \"opacity\" , } Note All of the examples above are shown with furigana on hover. They will also work with furigana on click. Collapsed Fields \u00b6 Automatically open collapsed fields \u00b6 Collapsed fields are collapsed by default. These fields can be set to be automatically opened under the following runtime option : { \"modules\" : { \"customize-open-fields\" : { ... } } } Example Config (click here) \"customize-open-fields\" : { \"enabled\" : false , // Force a field to be always open \"open\" : [ \"Secondary Definition\" ], // Opens the specified collapsable field if the card is new. \"open-on-new-enabled\" : { \"type\" : \"pc-mobile\" , \"pc\" : true , \"mobile\" : false }, \"open-on-new\" : [ \"Extra Info\" ] } Default Using example config (new card) Using example config (non-new card) Do not hide empty collapsed fields \u00b6 Collapsable fields that are empty are usually not shown at all. This runtime option allows them to be shown (but greyed out) when empty. { \"greyed-out-collapsable-fields-when-empty\" : ... } Empty fields greyed out ( true ) Empty fields not shown ( false , default) Highlight the word within the tooltips \u00b6 New in version 0.11.0.0 (latest version: 0.11.0.4 ) Within the tooltips, the word is not highlighted by default. This CSS allows the words to be highlighted within the sentence. Highlighted Not Highlighted (default) Instructions (click here) Under extra/style.scss , add the following code: . hover-tooltip . hover-tooltip__sent-div b { font-weight : bold ; color : var ( --accent ); } Remove the \"(N/A)\" on cards with no pitch accents \u00b6 New in version 0.11.0.0 (latest version: 0.11.0.4 ) If the word has no pitch accent, the pitch accent is usually displayed as (N/A) . This indicator can be removed with the following CSS : Instructions (click here) Under extra/style.scss , add the following code: . dh-left__word-pitch-text : empty : before { content : \"\" } Keeping and removing newlines within the display sentence \u00b6 Warning New as of version 0.11.1.0 . This version is currently bleeding edge , so this feature cannot be used unless you compile the templates from the dev branch. You can add newlines to the Sentence field to make the full sentence field have cleaner line breaks. If you do this, you will need to regenerate the SentenceReading field if you are using furigana. However, these newlines are automatically removed from the display sentence if the width of the screen is determined to be too small. To override this option, you can use the following custom CSS : Instructions (click here) Keep all newlines Remove all newlines Remove all newlines when AltDisplay is not used Under extra/style.scss , add the following code: . expression . expression-inner br { display : inline !important ; } Under extra/style.scss , add the following code: . expression . expression-inner br { display : none !important ; } This only removes newlines when the AltDisplay (or AltDisplayPASentenceCard ) field is not being used as the display sentence. Under extra/style.scss , add the following code: . expression . expression-inner br { display : inline !important ; } . expression . expression-inner : not ( . expression-inner--altdisplay ) br { display : none !important ; } Removing the furigana on the word reading \u00b6 The following CSS removes the furigana on the word reading, while keeping the furigana on the kanjis within hover. TODO image Instructions (click here) Under extra/style.scss , add the following code: . dh-left__reading > ruby > rt { display : none ; } Changing colors \u00b6 Most color changes can be done by simply editing a CSS variable. These variables are shown at the very top of the main CSS sheet. For example, the following changes the main accent color of the card: Instructions (click here) Under extra/style.scss , add the following code: : root { --accent : #ff1fd1 ; /* hot pink */ } . night_mode { --accent : #ff7777 ; /* light red */ } Note To change any variable color for dark mode, you cannot use :root , even if you are only setting the color for night mode. You must use .night_mode . For example, doing the following will NOT change the accent for night mode: : root { /* only changes light mode accent, and will NOT change dark mode accent! */ --accent : #ff7777 ; } You must do this instead: /* changes the color for both light and dark mode */ : root { --accent : #ff7777 ; } . night_mode { --accent : #ff7777 ; } Removing the word / sentence at the top of the back side \u00b6 Warning New as of version 0.11.1.0 . This version is currently bleeding edge , so this feature cannot be used unless you compile the templates from the dev branch. For users who are only using one card type (e.g. only vocab cards with no sentence cards, TSCs, or anything else), it might be better to remove the tested content and the line below it. TODO image The tested content is shown at the back by default to allow the user to differentiate between card types on both sides of the card. However, this take up extra vertical space which is unnecessary if you are only using one card type. Instructions (click here) Use the following CSS : Under extra/style.scss , add the following code: . card-main--back . expression-wrapper { display : none ; } Conclusion \u00b6 Outside of the user interface, the note has plenty of fields you can use to further modify the card.

Warning Updating your card will DELETE ANY CHANGES you have made to the templates. Please make a complete backup of your collection before continuing to update your note. Updating: Via Python Script \u00b6 The recommended way to install the note is by using a python script. This will change the note in place, and gives you various options on how the note will be changed. Lastly, it will give you warnings on anything you have to change manually, such as Yomichan Templates. Why can't I just copy/paste the templates, or just re-install the .apkg file to update the note? It's not uncommon for updates to contain many changes outside of just the templates alone. For example, required Yomichan settings, add-on config changes, or sometimes even the data within the note fields must be changed. Additionally, the field list is changed somewhat frequently. Although settings outside of Anki cannot be changed automatically, almost all settings within Anki are automatically updated with the python script. Additionally, the python script will give you plenty of instructions on exactly how to update any Yomichan setting or add-on config change. Finally, installing the .apkg file when the field list is in any way different will actually create a new version of the note instead of replacing the old note, which may prove to be an even bigger hassle. Preliminary steps \u00b6 Ensure that your note is named exactly JP Mining Note . To do this, head over to: (Main Window) \u2192 Tools \u2192 Manage Note Types . If your note is named differently, please rename it to JP Mining Note . Note You can always change the name back after updating. Running the Script \u00b6 Command Line Windows The cross platform command line summary is shown below. A more user friendly set of instructions for Windows users is also available on the second tab, for people who have never used python or git before. # assuming you are at the root of the repo, i.e. after the following commands: # $ git clone https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jp-mining-note.git # $ cd jp-mining-note # grabs the latest version of the master branch git pull origin/master cd tools # Make sure you have Anki open and Anki-Connect installed! # Also ensure that your python version is 3.10.6 or higher. # Note: Linux users may have to use `python3` instead of `python`. python install.py --update This section explains how to run the script on Windows if you have never used python or git before. Install Python version 3.10.6 or above, if you haven't already. I recommend using the latest stable version if you have not downloaded Python before. Additionally, make sure the box for \"Add Python to PATH\" is checked. (This is a common error for people to make. Please pay attention to this step!) Get the latest version of the repository. The easiest way to do this is by heading to the main repository , click on the green Code dropdown, and then download the zip by the Download Zip button. After that, unzip the directory. Open command prompt, and cd (change directory) into jp-mining-note/tools . If you don't know how to do that, see this or this . With your current directory being the tools directory, run the following command: python install.py --update Once you run the command, further instructions should be given to you through the command line interface. Common Errors \u00b6 This section will document common errors that occur when running the install.py script. Anki-Connect is missing actions \u00b6 Anki-Connect is likely outdated. To fix this, remove and re-download Anki-Connect from the AnkiWeb page . Note It seems that the Check for Updates occasionally fails to update the add-on, despite the fact that a newer version of the add-on exists. That is why I recommend re-downloading from the AnkiWeb page instead of using this feature. FieldVerifierException \u00b6 This class of errors means that the field list was edited at some point after the installation or last update of JPMN. The field list can be accessed by navigating to the following: (Main window) \u2192 Browse \u2192 Fields... . The install.py is picky about fields and its order, and by default, the script will reject any note type with modifications to the field list. To fix this, there are a few cases to go through. The field order has been changed. If the field order has been changed, and nothing else has been changed, you should be able to preserve your existing field list order by running the installation script with the --ignore-order flag (i.e. python3 install.py --ignore-order ). Alternatively, you can simply re-order the fields back to their original position. Note If you use --ignore-order , all new fields will be added to the very end of the field list (i.e. under Comment ). Additionally, any fields that were supposed to be repositioned will stay in place. It is up to you to move the fields to the appropriate places. New field(s) have been created. You have two options. Neither of these will delete your existing field(s). If you want to preserve your existing field list order, then you can run the script with the --ignore-order flag, like above. If you want to have the field list order match exactly with the current note, then re-order all the new fields to be below the last Comment field. Of course, this can be a temporary move; you can move the fields back to their previous positions after the update. Note On rare occasions, you might have added a field that serves the same purpose as a field that will be created on update. If so, rename your field to the field that will be added, and move the field under the Comment field. For example, if your note doesn't have PAPositions but you added a field Positions that fulfills the same purpose, then rename Positions to PAPositions . Field(s) were removed or renamed. Unfortunately, there is no way to ignore removed or renamed fields. If you removed a field, please re-add the field. Likewise, if you renamed a field, please rename it back to the original name. See here for more info on why they cannot be ignored. Updating: Manually \u00b6 Warning This method is not recommended whatsoever . Furthermore, very limited support will be given if you attempt this method. Click here to see the steps on how to update the note manually. Sometimes, you may be able to update the card simply by re-installing the newer version of the .apkg . However, this has the main caveat where if any of the fields are added, renamed, repositioned or deleted between card versions, this will not work (and instead add a new version of JP Mining Note , e.g. named JP Mining Note-b320fa ). Additionally, if you manually edited any of the fields, then this method will not work. To see if the fields have been changed, compare the first two numbers in the version you want to install to the first two numbers of the current card version . If the first two numbers match, then you are likely safe to manually update the card. If they don't match, then you MAY be able to get away with installing it anyways and transferring the old note types to the new note type. For example, a possible way to update the note is: Install the new version of the note. Select all the cards you want to transfer to the version, and change note type. Remove the old note type. Rename the new note type to the old note type name ( JP Mining Note ). See the changelog to see how the fields have changed and how you have to map the old fields to the new fields. After Updating the Card \u00b6 There may be further steps outside of just updating the card, such as updating Yomichan's templates / format. Further instructions on these are written below. Afterwards, please see the final steps section. Updating Yomichan's Anki Card Format \u00b6 To update the Yomichan Format, the steps should be almost the same as the one specified already in the setup . The most important difference is that if a new field was added or a field has been renamed, then the field will not show up automatically in Yomichan . Warning Doing the above WILL clear all the fields that you previously had, unless there is a matching field in that other card. Refreshing Yomichan Fields \u00b6 Video Demo (click here) As always, create a backup of your Yomichan settings, just in case. After running install.py --update , create a temporary copy of the note by: Tools \u2192 Manage Note Types \u2192 Add \u2192 Select Clone: JP Mining Note \u2192 Ok \u2192 Name the note anything you want (the following examples will use JP Mining Note copy ) \u2192 Ok \u2192 Close If you are currently viewing Yomichan Settings, please refresh the page. Head over to Anki Card Format as before . In the top right corner, change Model to JP Mining Note copy , and then change it back to JP Mining Note . (If you don't see JP Mining Note copy , please refresh the page.) Update the fields as specified. It should be specified in the text you see when running install.py --update . However, you should also simply compare the table on the setup page to your filled out fields. Remove the temporary note: Tools \u2192 Manage Note Types \u2192 (select JP Mining Note copy ) \u2192 Delete Explanation Using the temporary copy of the updated card means that fields that remain unchanged between the old card and new card will be transferred automatically in the Yomichan Format. If you simply choose some random model like Basic , then almost none of the fields will be preserved, as the Basic card does not have any matching fields with the JP Mining Note model. Updating Yomichan Templates \u00b6 Like the above, you can simply follow the steps already specified in setup . Again, please make a backup of your Yomichan settings just in case, and again, please make sure you reset the existing templates (unless you know what you are doing). Note that your Yomichan template options will be reset if you follow all the steps. I recommend temporarily saving a copy of the Yomichan templates so you can easily reset your Yomichan template options after updating. Updating the Runtime Options File \u00b6 The runtime options does not automatically update with each note update, as to not override the user's configuration on each update. If the options file isn't updated, then the note will simply use the default value for the option. However, if certain runtime options no longer work, you may have to update this file, as it is possible for the configuration file layout to have changed between versions. The most recent version of the options file can always be found here . if you want to update it. Final Steps \u00b6 By now, you should be done updating the note! Please do the following checks to make sure everything properly works: Preview an existing card, to ensure that nothing looks odd. Create a new card and make sure nothing looks odd.

These options are applied on card creation, so changing these options will only affect cards created in the future. Accessing & Editing \u00b6 To access the Yomichan template options, head to the Yomichan templates as normal: Navigate to Yomichan Settings. Make sure that advanced settings are turned on (bottom left corner). Go to the Anki section Select Configure Anki card templates... The options should be available at the very top of the template code. Custom Markers \u00b6 Additional markers can be used under the Yomichan Fields to further customize what happens during card creation time. Custom card types on hiragana-only cards \u00b6 Warning New as of version 0.11.1.0 .

Markers: {jpmn-filled-if-word-is-hiragana} \u30fb {jpmn-filled-if-word-is-not-hiragana} If the word is purely comprised of hiragana, you can create different card types by default using these markers. For example, let's say you want the default card to be a vocab card, but want hiragana terms to be TSCs . To do exactly that, do the following: Navigate to Yomichan settings, and then to Anki \u2192 Configure Anki card format... . Set IsTargetedSentenceCard to {jpmn-filled-if-word-is-hiragana} .

See the setup section to see how to install and create cards with this note type.","title":"Home"},{"location":"cardtypes/","text":"Previously, this note type only had vocab and sentence cards. Although I was originally fine with this, I started to realize some issues with only having these two card types: Vocab cards that require context have to be turned into sentence cards, and Sentence cards take a very long time to review, and can create context-based memories. I found that many vocab cards had to be turned into sentence cards, since either the context was fundamental to understanding the definition, or there were other parts of the sentence that I wanted to test. This lead to many sentence cards, which naturally meant that Anki sessions lasted longer. I attempted to tackle these exact issues by introducing new card types outside of the fundamental vocab and sentence cards. Vocab Card \u00b6 A vocab card simply shows the target word at the front. You test yourself on the reading and definition of the word. How to create: This is the default card type. Nothing has to be done for the card to be a vocab card. Sentence Card \u00b6 A sentence card simply shows the entire sentence at the front. You test yourself on the reading and meaning of the entire sentence. How to create: Fill the IsSentenceCard field. Targetted Sentence Card (TSC) \u00b6 A targetted sentence card is a special case of the sentence card. The sentence is shown at the front, but only the highlighted content (only the word by default) is tested. This card type was originally defined here . Note that this is really just a special case of the normal sentence card, where the highlighted content is only the tested word. How to create: Fill the IsTargetedSentenceCard field. Hybrid Cards \u00b6 Hybrid cards are a group of card types that attempt to combine the power of sentence cards and vocab cards into one. They all have the distinct feature that the word is shown at the front, but the sentence can be shown through some natural means. Hover Vocab Card \u00b6 A hover vocab word shows the tested word at the front. When you hover over the word, you can see the full sentence, with the tested word highlighted. This acts similarly to a vocab card. However, you are given the option to see the full sentence without failing the card. This is also known as the fallback card . Indicator: Yellow & dashed underline under the word. How to test: Attempt to guess the reading and definition of the word without hovering over the word. If you are able to guess both the reading and definition of the word, flip the card. Otherwise, hover over the word and guess the reading and definition of the word with the entire sentence. How to create: Fill the IsHoverCard field. Note For all forms of hover cards, you can press \"shift\" to toggle whether the sentence is shown or not. Click Vocab Card \u00b6 A click vocab word shows the tested word at the front. When you click on the word, you can see the full sentence, with the tested word highlighted. This card acts as an intermediary between the hover vocab card and the vocab card itself. You must guess the reading BEFORE revealing the sentence, but you can use the sentence to guess the definition. Indicator: White & dashed underline under the word. How to test: Attempt to guess the reading of the word without hovering over the word. If you are unable to guess the reading of the word before revealing the entire sentence, then the card must be marked as a fail . After guessing the reading of the word, you can optionally click on the word to reveal the entire sentence to guess the definition. In other words, if you can only guess the definition by reading the sentence, then the card should still be passed. How to create: Fill the IsClickCard field. Hover Sentence Card \u00b6 This acts similarly to the hover vocab card. However, the tested content is the entire sentence, so you must hover over the word to test the entire sentence. Indicator: Yellow & solid underline under the word. How to test: Attempt to guess the reading and definition of the word without hovering over the word. Regardless of whether you are able to guess the reading and definition of the word, hover over the word and test yourself on the sentence (as if it was a sentence card). How to create: Fill the IsHoverCard and IsSentenceCard fields. Click Sentence Card \u00b6 This acts similar to the click vocab card. However, similarly to the hover sentence card, the tested content is the entire display, so you must click the word to test the entire display Indicator: White & solid underline under the word. How to test: Attempt to guess the reading of the word without hovering over the word. If you are unable to guess the reading of the word before revealing the entire sentence, then the card must be marked as a fail . After guessing the reading of the word, click on the word to reveal the entire sentence, and test yourself on the sentence (as if it was a sentence card). How to create: Fill the IsClickCard and IsSentenceCard fields. Hybrid TSC \u00b6 Similarly to the normal TSC, if you want to use the hover sentence card or click sentence card to only test a specific portion of the sentence, you can bold the desired selection of the sentence and fill IsTargetedSentenceCard . The above example is a Hover TSC, with the last sentence was bolded.

Card Editing \u00b6 How do I use this note type as an Anime Card? \u00b6 Anime Cards are simply regular vocab cards with a non-collapsable hint field. To use this as an Anime Card, follow the steps to make a vocab card ( here ), and use the HintNotHidden field for your hint. How do I change the default value of a binary field? \u00b6 In Yomichan Format, you can simply toggle the field. Any new card that is created will now default to that default value. Of course, this will not affect existing cards. To change existing cards, I recommend bulk-editing your cards, say, with this add-on . (TODO write a way with python) Note You technically have a second option, and that is to change the code itself (i.e. flip # with ^ for the desired field). However, you should only do this if you know what you are doing, and are fine with knowing that you may lose those changes if you update this note. How do I remove an empty card without deleting the entire note? \u00b6 Quote To remove the empty cards, go to Tools \u2192 Empty Cards in the main window.

Note If you are simply importing old JPMN notes, updating JPMN will properly update all the notes in place. See this section instead. Introduction \u00b6 Unfortunately, there are so many card formats out there that it would be impossible to cover how to import from every format with detailed rigor. Instead, this section will give you some general tips on operations that will likely be common across most or all formats, as well as present a small example for Anime Cards. Additionally, although you maybe able to import most of the card, it is unlikely that you will have complete 100% full functionality after importing the notes. The biggest example is frequency list information, as it requires special HTML + css formatting that can only be specified in the Yomichan Templates section. Prerequisites \u00b6 Before doing anything that affects your Anki collection in a major way, please make a complete backup of your collection (Main Window \u2192 File (top left corner) \u2192 Export... \u2192 Anki Collection Package ). Note Importing your previous notes shouldn't change your media files at all. However I recommend exporting with media just in case, so long as you have the disk space for it. As explained further below, you will likely need to batch edit your newly imported notes. There are two ways you can do this: If you have python , then you're already set. Otherwise, you require a batch editing add-on. I recommend this one . Anki \u00b6 Anki provides a feature to switch between note types, without affecting scheduling information. To do this, follow the proceeding steps: Head to the Card Browser window (Main Window \u2192 Browse ) Select all the cards that you want to switch Tip: ctrl+a selects all cards in the browser. Right click the selection \u2192 Notes \u2192 Change Note Type... (TODO gif) Mapping Fields \u00b6 Here is where I can't give specific advice, as every note is different. However, here are a few tips: Your card likely doesn't have a separate Key and Word field, and instead only contains one Word field. To import this correctly into JPMN, make sure JPMN's Key and Word field are exactly your old card's Word field. WordPitch and SentenceReading can be left empty, as the AJT plugins can batch generate both word pitches and sentence furigana. You may have some word pitch fields already in your card. The only thing you should import is the pitch accent graphs, into the PAGraphs field. PA positions and PA text should be ignored. You may have frequency list info already in your card. As a quick warning, although you are free to import that info it may not work as you would expect in the JPMN card. Because there's no standard way to store this data, there is no convenience function to convert it to the proper format. See the field reference (TODO link) for more information about other fields.

The following step differs if you are using python or the Batch Note Editing Add-on. If you are using python : # assuming you are at the root of the repo, # i.e. after the `git clone ...` and `cd jp-mining-note` cd ./tools # make sure you have Anki open and Anki-Connect installed! python3 ./batch.py -f \"set_pasilence_field\" Otherwise, if you are using the add-on, follow the instructions in the videos Head over to Edit (top left corner) \u2192 Batch Edit... .

CSS (Yomichan) \u00b6 How to Add Custom CSS In Yomichan \u00b6 To add custom CSS in Yomichan, do the following: Head over to Yomichan settings (Yomichan extension marker -> cogwheel) Go to Appearance \u2192 Configure custom CSS... Add the CSS to the top section. Close the window. Not selecting or copying furigana \u00b6 If you want to select / copy the main word within Yomichan without copying the furigana, you can use the following CSS: . headword-term ruby rt { user-select : none ; } Note The above is actually general enough to use for Anki cards itself, say with the following CSS: ruby rt { user-select : none ; } Unfortunately, the above doesn't seem to work on Linux (tested on Ubuntu / Xfce, Anki Qt6 2.1.54). Limiting the number of frequency lists \u00b6 /* Only shows the first 2 frequency lists */ span . frequency-group-item : nth-child ( n + 3 ) { display : none ; } (Thanks Marv#5144 for the CSS) Limiting the number of pitch accent dictionaries \u00b6 The following CSS displays only the first 2 pitch accent dictionaries: /* Only shows the first 2 pitch accent dictionaries */ li . pronunciation-group : nth-child ( n + 3 ) { display : none ; } Make the pitch accent dictionary text a bit grey by default, and to make specifically the \"NHK\" and \"\u5927\u8f9e\u6cc9\" white (change these two to any dictionary you find to be of higher quality) /* Greys out all pitch accent dictionary names */ /* Sets NHK and \u5927\u8f9e\u6cc9 pitch accent dictionaries to a white name */ . tag [ data-category = \"pronunciation-dictionary\" ] { --tag-text-color : #c8bfdb ; } . tag [ data-details = \"\u5927\u8f9e\u6cc9\" ], . tag [ data-details = \"NHK\" ] { --tag-text-color : #FFFFFF ; } Hide the dictionary, but allow it to be used by Anki \u00b6 The default way to hide a dictionary is by disabling the dictionary under Yomichan's Dictionaries section. However, if you disable the dictionary, you cannot export it into Anki, which is a problem if you are using a bilingual profile but you want to export monolingual definitions. Steps : 1. Ensure that the dictionary is enabled in your Yomichan profile. 1. Add the following CSS for the desired dictionaries (this has to be done for each individual dictionary): li . definition-item [ data-dictionary = 'DICTIONARY' ] { display : none ; } Click here to see an example. li . definition-item [ data-dictionary = 'JMdict (English)' ] { display : none ; } Hide bilingual definitions until hover \u00b6 Add the following CSS for the desired dictionaries (this has to be done for each individual dictionary): li . definition-item [ data-dictionary = 'DICTIONARY' ] . gloss-list { opacity : 0 ; } li . definition-item [ data-dictionary = 'DICTIONARY' ] : hover . gloss-list { opacity : 1 ; } Click here to see an example. li . definition-item [ data-dictionary = 'JMdict (English)' ] . gloss-list { opacity : 0 ; } li . definition-item [ data-dictionary = 'JMdict (English)' ] : hover . gloss-list { opacity : 1 ; } Remove the \"Add Reading\" button \u00b6 button [ title ^= \"Add reading\" ] { display : none ; } Left: without CSS. Right: with CSS. CSS (General) \u00b6 Ensuring \u300c\u300d properly quotes the text \u00b6 . text { text-indent : -1 em ; padding-left : 1 em ; } On the example to the right, the first quote is the standard display without any custom CSS. The second quote is with the aforementioned CSS. An example JSFiddle can be found here . Yomichan Templates / Handlebars \u00b6 How to Edit Yomichan Fields \u00b6 Navigate to Yomichan Settings.

Note that this setup is primarly PC based, and requires Anki and Yomichan for the main card creation process. Prerequisites \u00b6 It is highly recommend that you are using the latest Anki version (or as close as you can get to the latest Anki version), as the note is primarily tested and maintained on the latest versions of Anki. Additionally, it is recommeded to use the Qt6 version of Anki if possible. Note Worst case scenario, if any essential add-ons no longer work, you can always downgrade back to your current version. Similarly, if you downloaded Yomichan from a file, I recommend updating that as well. (Most users should have installed it from their browser's extension page, in which case nothing has to be done). Installing the Card \u00b6 There are two ways of installing the card: Option 1: The Automatic Way (click here) If you know what git and python is, here's all you have to do: Windows MacOS & Linux git clone \"https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jp-mining-note.git\" cd jp-mining-note # Ensure you have Anki open, and with anki-connect running # Also ensure that you have python 3.10+ installed. # It *MAY* work with lower versions of python, but I make no such guarantee. ;) python tools\\install.py git clone \"https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jp-mining-note.git\" cd jp-mining-note # Ensure you have Anki open, and with anki-connect running # Also ensure that you have python 3.10+ installed. # It *MAY* work with lower versions of python, but I make no such guarantee. ;) # You may have to use `python3` instead of `python`. python tools/install.py The above does the following: Installs the latest version of the note Installs the fonts required for the note If the above made no sense to you, or you just want to install this normally, see the second option below. Option 2: The Manual Way (click here) Go to the releases page and download the cards from the latest release. You should download the {version}-jpmn_example_cards.apkg file. After you download the cards, import them by navigating to Anki by doing the following: File (top left corner) \u2192 Import... By default, the custom fonts do not come with the .apkg file. To install these fonts, head over to this repository's media folder and download the 4 .otf files. Move the .otf files into the media folder of your profile ( Anki2/PROFILENAME/collections.media ). Verifying the Note Works \u00b6 You should see a deck JPMN-Examples in your collection. View one of the cards and make sure the card looks similar to the one below: Please check the following in particular: The fonts should match very similarly with the above example. Notice how at the top left corner, the info circle (the \"i\" encased within the circle) is the default grey color. If this is red, that means something is wrong with the note's javascript. Please see this section for basic troubleshooting. Clicking on the image to zoom should work out of the box. Anki Setup \u00b6 For this card type to work, some Anki add-ons are required to connect to external sources and to auto-generate certain fields. There are also certain add-ons that will not be supported by this note type. Please disable them and restart Anki before continuing. Conflicting add-ons \u00b6 None since I'm not aware of any currently. Let me know if you find one! Required Anki add-ons \u00b6 To download all the required add-ons, copy and paste the following numbers into the Add-ons window. ( Tools \u2192 Add-ons \u2192 Get Add-ons... ) 2055492159 181103283 After installing the add-ons, you will have to change the configs of the add-ons to work with this note type. Continue reading to see the required config changes. Anki-Connect \u00b6 (Official page) Code: 2055492159 Required for Yomichan and most other Anki-related automated tasks to work. I use the default config that comes with the add-on. Note Some older versions of Anki (2.1.49 and below) require a hack to the Anki-Connect config for certain features within the card to work. In particular, Anki-Connect is used for the Kanji Hover feature and the \"Open Extra Info on New Card\" feature. To make those features work, add \"null\" to the webCorsOriginList list in the Anki-Connect config file. An example of how the config should look is shown below: \"webCorsOriginList\": [ \"http://localhost\", \"null\" ] Of course, this isn't very safe and it is highly recommended that you upgrade Anki to avoid this problem. If you don't care for those features, you can disable them in the runtime options . CSS Injector \u00b6 (Official page) Code: 181103283 This add-on is not strictly necessary. However, if you don't use this, the fields within the Anki field editor won't have certain stylizations that makes the field actually interpretable, so I strongly recommend using this. There are two ways of using css injector with this note type: Option 1: Automatically updates with the card (recommended) Windows MacOS Linux As a preliminary step, you will have to remove the empty field.css file that comes with the add-on. That can be done through command line (below), or you can simply navigate to the Anki2/addons21/181103283/user_files folder (within the addons folder ) and delete field.css . # be sure to change USERNAME to your computer username! del \"C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Anki2\\addons21\\181103283\\user_files\\field.css\" Afterwards, run the following command in command prompt with elevated permissions: # be sure to change USERNAME to your computer username and PROFILENAME to your Anki profile. # There are **two** USERNAME's to replace, and **one** PROFILENAME to replace in the command below. # Make sure to replace all the fields! mklink \"C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Anki2\\addons21\\181103283\\user_files\\field.css\" \"C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Anki2\\PROFILENAME\\collection.media\\_field.css\" Note Be sure to run the last command in command prompt, and not PowerShell. If you've never used command prompt before, see this . As a preliminary step, you will have to remove the empty field.css file that comes with the add-on. That can be done through command line (below), or you can simply navigate to the Anki2/addons21/181103283/user_files folder (within the addons folder ) and delete field.css . rm \"~/Library/Application Support/Anki2/addons21/181103283/user_files/field.css\" Afterwards, run the following command: # be sure to change `PROFILENAME` to your Anki profile ln -s \"~/Library/Application Support/Anki2/PROFILENAME/collection.media/_field.css\" \"~/Library/Application Support/Anki2/addons21/181103283/user_files/field.css\" As a preliminary step, you will have to remove the empty field.css file that comes with the add-on. That can be done through command line (below), or you can simply navigate to the Anki2/addons21/181103283/user_files folder (within the addons folder ) and delete field.css . rm \"~/.local/share/Anki2/addons21/181103283/user_files/field.css\" Afterwards, run the following command: # be sure to change `PROFILENAME` to your Anki profile ln -s \"~/.local/share/Anki2/PROFILENAME/collection.media/_field.css\" \"~/.local/share/Anki2/addons21/181103283/user_files/field.css\" Option 2: Manually without respecting updates Navigate to css injector addon folder ( Anki2/addons21/181103283/user_files ) Remove the existing field.css file Copy the _field.css file (found under your profile's media folder ) into the css injector add-on directory. Rename _field.css into field.css . Note If the _field.css file ever updates, you will have to manually copy and rename the file again into the correct position. Optional Add-ons \u00b6 These are a set of optional, but useful add-ons that can easily work with the card. AJT Furigana \u00b6 (Official page) Code: 1344485230 Alternative and up-to-date version of JapaneseSupport. Automatically generates furigana upon Yomichan card creation. This add-on is optional, because the card will simply show the sentence without furigana if there is no furigana generated sentence. Note Furigana generation is occasionally incorrect, so if you plan on using these regularly, you should double-check the readings to make sure they are correct. Config Changes \u00b6 To change the config of any Anki add-on, head over to Tools \u2192 Add-ons \u2192 (select the add-on) \u2192 Config . The important things to change in the config are generate_on_note_add , fields and note_types . Click here to see the full AJT Furigana config { \"context_menu\" : { \"generate_furigana\" : true , \"generate_furigana_no_kanji\" : true , \"to_hiragana\" : true , \"to_katakana\" : true }, \"fields\" : [ // (1)! { \"destination\" : \"SentenceReading\" , \"source\" : \"Sentence\" } ], \"furigana_suffix\" : \" (furigana)\" , \"generate_on_note_add\" : true , // (2)! \"note_types\" : [ // (3)! \"jp\" ], \"skip_numbers\" : false , \"skip_words\" : \"\" , \"toolbar\" : { \"clean_furigana_button\" : { \"enable\" : false , \"shortcut\" : \"Alt+u\" , \"text\" : \"\u524a\" }, \"furigana_button\" : { \"enable\" : false , \"shortcut\" : \"Alt+o\" , \"text\" : \"\u632f\" } } } We change the field names to match this note type. This ensures that the pitch accent is added upon initial note creation. Note that this is technically optional. If you are likely to change the sentence after adding the note, then it is possible to leave this as false , and bulk add the furigana later. Similarly to the fields change, we change this to properly detect this note type. AJT Pitch Accent \u00b6 (Official page) Code: 1225470483 Automatically adds pitch accent info given the word. For the purposes of the card, the only purpose that this add-on serves is the following: - Adds devoiced and nasal information to the existing reading. - If your Yomichan pitch accent dictionaries did not contain any pitch accent info for the word but the add-on does, then it will use the add-on data. Config Changes \u00b6 The important things to change in the config are generate_on_note_add , destination_fields , source_fields note_types , and styles . Click here to see the full AJT Pitch Accent config { \"destination_fields\" : [ \"AJTWordPitch\" ], \"generate_on_note_add\" : true , // (1)! \"kana_lookups\" : true , \"lookup_shortcut\" : \"Ctrl+8\" , \"note_types\" : [ \"jp\" ], \"regenerate_readings\" : false , \"skip_words\" : \"\u3078,\u304b,\u3088,\u3093,\u3060,\u3073,\u306e,\u3084,\u306d,\u3070,\u3066,\u3068,\u305f,\u304c,\u306b,\u306a,\u306f,\u3082,\u307e\u3059,\u304b\u3089,\u3044\u308b,\u305f\u3061,\u3066\u308b,\u3046,\u307e\u3057\u3087,\u305f\u3044,\u3067\u3059\" , \"source_fields\" : [ \"Word\" ], \"styles\" : { // (2)! \"&#42780;\" : \"<span class=\\\"downstep\\\"><span class=\\\"downstep-inner\\\">&#42780;</span></span>\" , \"class=\\\"overline\\\"\" : \"style=\\\"text-decoration:overline;\\\" class=\\\"pitchoverline\\\"\" }, \"use_hiragana\" : false , \"use_mecab\" : true } We change generate_on_note_add and note_types for the exact same reasons as the AJT Furigana Config section. The destination_fields and source_fields options are changed similarily to the fields option in the AJT Furigana Config section. styles adds custom stylization that creates the pitch accent lines and downsteps as you see in the example note. Without this, the default styles will look like the word you see in the official add-on page. Final Steps \u00b6 After the above setup, make sure to restart Anki for the add-ons and config changes to take effect. If the css injector add-on is installed correctly, your Anki field editor should now have color! Additionally, now that Anki-Connect is installed, kanji hover should also be functioning. Hover over a kanji within the word reading to make sure that a popup appears. In particular, the \u8005 kanji in the example \u507d\u8005 and \u4e0d\u5be9\u8005 cards should point to each other. Transfer Existing Notes \u00b6 If you wish to transfer existing cards into this note type, please see this page . Updating the Note \u00b6 If you wish to update the note, follow the steps in this page . Be assured that this note doesn't auto-update, and you have to manually update the note if you want it to update. Yomichan Setup \u00b6 Yomichan is the main program that will create the cards. You can download Yomichan as a Firefox extension or under the Chrome web store. This section will go over the minimal Yomichan setup to work with this card type. If you have never used Yomichan before , please see this page first to get it working. Preliminary Steps \u00b6 If you have used Yomichan before, please make a backup of your settings (just in case): Navigate to Yomichan Settings. Go to the Backup section Select Export Settings Yomichan Fields \u00b6 To edit the fields that Yomichan will automatically fill out, do the following: Navigate to Yomichan Settings. Go to the Anki section. Select Anki card format... . Set \"Model\" as JP Mining Note . Copy and paste the following values into the fields (the custom markers won't be available in the dropdown arrow): Click here to see the fields to copy and paste.

Note Anything field marked with * are binary fields, and should be configured to each user's personal preferences. To change the default value of any of the fields, simply fill the field in within the aforementioned Anki card format... section. The custom markers like {jpmn-primary-definition} is not provided by Yomichan by default. See the section below to make these markers usable. Yomichan Templates \u00b6 Yomichan supports user inserted template code that allows the automatic separation of bilingual and monolingual dictionary definitions, custom stylization, etc. This note type makes heavy use of these custom templates. To make the new markers usable, do the following: Navigate to Yomichan Settings. Make sure that advanced settings are turned on (bottom left corner). Go to the Anki section Select Configure Anki card templates... If you have existing template code already, I highly recommend resetting the templates (bottom right corner, red button) unless you know exactly what you are doing. After resetting the templates, without removing any of the existing template code, add the following template code as follows: Copy and paste the code below to the top of the default Yomichan template code: Click here to show the template code to copy. {{ ~!

Here's an excerpt of text you can test Yomichan on: \u300c\u3084\u3001\u3044\u3089\u3063\u3057\u3083\u3044\u3002\u307e\u3001\u6bd2\u3092\u98df\u3089\u308f\u3070\u76bf\u307e\u3067\u3063\u3066\u8a00\u3046\u3057\u306d\u3002\u3042\u3001\u9055\u3046\u304b\u3002\u4e57\u308a\u639b\u304b\u3063\u305f\u8239\uff1f\u300d Obviously, just Yomichan alone doesn't fill every field. Notably, the picture and sentence audio is missing. Outside of that, there are some final settings you can adjust within the Yomichan templates if the card doesn't look quite right. Yomichan Templates Settings \u00b6 Monolingual Definition \u00b6 If you want the first definition you see (the PrimaryDefinition field) to be monolingual, change the following line at the top of the templates code: {{ ~#set \"opt-first-definition-type\" \"bilingual\" }}{{ /set~ }} to {{ ~#set \"opt-first-definition-type\" \"monolingual\" }}{{ /set~ }} Categorization of Dictionaries \u00b6 If your dictionaries are ending up in the wrong sections, then it is likely a problem with how the template code categorizes the dictionaries. If you made a card above, check that your dictionaries are in the expected places. The foolproof way to check that your dictionaries are correctly categorized is with the {jpmn-test-dict-type} (new as of 0.9.1.2) marker. Under the Anki Templates code, replace Card field with {jpmn-test-dict-type} and press Test . An example output of the above (on the word \u7d50\u69cb) is the following: \u300c\u65fa\u6587\u793e\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \u7b2c\u5341\u4e00\u7248\u300d: monolingual \u300c\u660e\u93e1\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \u7b2c\u4e8c\u7248\u300d: monolingual \u300c\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u65b0\u8f9e\u6797\u300d: monolingual \u300c\u65b0\u660e\u89e3\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \u7b2c\u4e94\u7248\u300d: monolingual \u300c\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5927\u8f9e\u6cc9\u300d: monolingual \u300cNHK\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u767a\u97f3\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u65b0\u8f9e\u5178\u300d: utility \u300cJMDict Surface Forms\u300d: utility \u300cJMdict (English)\u300d: bilingual \u300cJMdict (English)\u300d: bilingual \u300cJMdict (English)\u300d: bilingual \u300cJMdict (English)\u300d: bilingual \u300cJMdict (English)\u300d: bilingual \u300c\u65b0\u548c\u82f1\u300d: bilingual If a dictionary is miscategorized, you will have to edit bilingual-dict-regex or utility-dict-regex at the top of the template code. Monolingual dictionaries are considered to be dictionaries that aren't either of the two above, so no handlebars code has to be changed if one were to use more monolingual dictionaries. To see how to edit the regex, go to this section . Ignoring a Dictionary \u00b6 If you want to see the dictionary on Yomichan but not have it show on Anki, you can use the ignored-dict-regex option. To see how to edit the option, see the section below . Conversely, if you want to not see the dictionary on Yomichan but want it to show up on Anki, see here . Editing the dictionary regex \u00b6 To modify a regex string: Determine the exact tag your dictionary has. To see this, take a word that has a definition in the desired dictionary, and test {jpmn-test-dict-type} like above. The string inside the quotes \u300c\u300d is exactly the tag of the dictionary. Add the dictionary tag to the string, by replacing ADD_x_DICTIONARIES_HERE . For example, if your bilingual dictionary tag is Amazing Dictionary , change ADD_BILINGUAL_DICTIONARIES_HERE to Amazing Dictionary . If you want to add more than one dictionary, they have to be joined with the | character. For example, if you want to add the bilingual dictionaries Amazing Dictionary and Somewhat-Okay-Dictionary , change ADD_BILINGUAL_DICTIONARIES_HERE to Amazing Dictionary|Somewhat-Okay-Dictionary . For completeness, here is the modified line for the second example: {{ ~#set \"bilingual-dict-regex\" ~ }} ^(([Jj][Mm][Dd]ict)(?! Surface Forms)(.*)|\u65b0\u548c\u82f1.*|\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u6587\u6cd5\u8f9e\u5178.*|Amazing Dictionary|Somewhat-Okay-Dictionary)(\\[object Object\\])?$ {{ ~/set~ }} Other Yomichan Settings \u00b6 Again, if you have never used Yomichan before, I recommend checking out this page . If you are planning on using the JMDict dictionary, I recommend downloading from the official site and using yomichan-import to get the latest jmdict version available. This is because other sources could have older definitions, which usually means less accurate definitions. This link has further template code, which creates markers for individual dictionaries. This has certain extended capabilities over my template code, such as removing the first line. Instructions on adding Forvo as an alternate audio source to Yomichan can be found here Creating the Cards \u00b6 I use a texthooker setup, which is able to extract subtitles or text into the browser. Once the text is on the browser, you can use Yomichan to select the word and create the Anki card (click on the green plus button). The classic texthooker setup works for most games, and any show with subtitle files. This texthooker process has already been explained in great detail by many other smart people in the following links: Texthooker basics Texthooker basics & Visual Novels The setup also works with video files if the video player supports automated copying of subtitles, and if you have the correct subtitle files. MPV with either mpvacious or Immersive add-ons supports this workflow, as detailed in the next section. Many anime subtitle files can be found under kitsuneko . Automating Pictures and Sentence Audio \u00b6 If you've made it this far, then congratulations! Most fields of the cards have been automatically filled out, just from Yomichan alone! Yomichan is able to automatically generate everything EXCEPT the pictures and sentence audio from the media you are consuming. Fortunately, that can be automated as well. However, the tools to automate that will likely be slightly different for each individual user as it depends on what media they consume, operating system / device, etc. Instead of walking you through how to get these to work, I will instead provide a list of resources you can use. Of course, this list is incomplete, and there could be tools better suited for your workflow. mpvacious add-on for MPV , a cross platform media player. Personally tested. Given a subtitle file for a movie file, it can automatically add sentence audio and images with one Ctrl+n command. Immersive A powerful alternative to the mpvacious add-on above, with certain different capabilities. Can also be used to automatically extract sentence audio and pictures. asbplayer Cross platform (chromium) browser video player. Personally tested. This also has card image and audio exporting capabilities. Works on video streaming sites as well. Animebook Cross platform (chromium) browser video player. This also has card image and audio exporting capabilities. ShareX Windows media recorder which can both take screenshots and record audio. Personally tested. This can be automated to add audio and pictures to the most recently added anki card by following the instructions here . Useful for things that don't have an easy way of getting audio, such as visual novels. ames ShareX alternative for Linux. Personally tested. Primarily used to automate audio and picture extraction to the most recently added anki card. jidoujisho Android reader and media player, which can also create Anki cards. Note that this app does NOT use Yomichan, which means that certain fields may not be filled automatically mokuro This is not something that can automatically add images or audio to your cards, BUT it allows you to use popup-dictionaries like Yomichan on manga (an actual game-changer). Other \u00b6 Additional Anki add-on(s) \u00b6 These add-on(s) assist in card creation, but are ultimately optional. Paste Images As WebP (link) Separate Pitch Accent Deck \u00b6 If you want card types to go to a different deck by default, you can change it by doing the following: Browse (top middle) \u2192 Cards... (around the middle of the screen, right above first field of the note. This is NOT the Cards dropdown menu at the top right corner) \u2192 Card Type dropdown (top of the screen) \u2192 (choose pitch accent card type) \u2192 Options (the first Options you see at the very top of the screen) \u2192 Deck Override...

Most fields of the cards have been automatically filled out, just from Yomichan alone! Yomichan is able to automatically generate everything EXCEPT the pictures and sentence audio from the media you are consuming. Fortunately, that can be automated as well. However, the tools to automate that will likely be slightly different for each individual user as it depends on what media they consume, operating system / device, etc. Instead of walking you through how to get these to work, I will instead provide a list of resources you can use. Of course, this list is incomplete, and there could be tools better suited for your workflow. mpvacious add-on for MPV , a cross platform media player. Personally tested.

Warning Updating your card will DELETE ANY CHANGES you have made to the templates. Please make a complete backup of your collection (Main Window \u2192 File (top left corner) \u2192 Export... \u2192 Anki Collection Package ). Method 1: Python Script (recommended) \u00b6 The recommended way to install the note is by using a python script. This will change the note in place, and gives you various options on how the note will be changed. Lastly, it will give you warnings on anything you have to change manually, such as Yomichan Templates. Anki-Connect: Dev Version \u00b6 At the time of writing this (2022/09/07), you will need the developer version of Anki-Connect, because the Anki web version of Anki-Connect is too old and does not have the required API calls that the installation script will likely need (calls related to field editing). Click here to see how to install the dev version of Anki-Connect. You can install Anki-Connect-Dev in one of two ways: Command Line Installation (MacOS and Linux ONLY) Manual Installation git clone https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect.git cd anki-connect ./link.sh Download the zip of the Anki-Connect repository , by clicking on the green Code dropdown, and then download the zip by the Download Zip button. After that, unzip the directory. Copy the plugin folder (found inside ./anki-connect ), and paste in the addons folder . Rename plugin to AnkiConnectDev . In the end, the file structure should look something like below: Anki2 L addons21 L AnkiConnectDev L __init__.py L config.json L config.md L edit.py ... After installing AnkiConnectDev : Disable the old Anki-Connect add-on. Restart Anki to apply the changes. To confirm you have the dev version installed, check your list of installed add-ons in Anki. You should be able to see AnkiConnectDev in the aforementioned list. Running the Script \u00b6 After installing Anki-Connect-Dev, you can now run the python script: Command Line Windows The cross platform command line summary is shown below. A more user friendly set of instructions for Windows users is also available on the second tab, for people who have never used python or git before. # assuming you are at the root of the repo, i.e. after the following commands: # $ git clone https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jp-mining-note.git # $ cd jp-mining-note # grabs the latest version of the master branch git pull origin/master cd tools # Make sure you have Anki open and Anki-Connect installed! # Also ensure that your python version is 3.10.6 or higher. # Note: Linux users may have to use `python3` instead of `python`. python install.py --update This section explains how to run the script on Windows if you have never used python or git before. Install Python . Any version above 3.10.6 should suffice. Make sure the box for \"Add Python to PATH\" is checked. (This is a common error for people to make. Please pay attention to this step!) Get the latest version of the repository. The easiest way to do this is by heading to the main repository , click on the green Code dropdown, and then download the zip by the Download Zip button. After that, unzip the directory. Open command prompt, and cd (change directory) into jp-mining-note/tools . If you don't know how to do that, see here . With your current directory being the tools directory, run the following command: python install.py --update Once you run the command, further instructions should be given to you through the command line interface. Method 2: Manually \u00b6 Warning This method is not recommended . Furthermore, very limited support will be given if you attempt this method. Click here to see the steps on how to update the note manually. Sometimes, you may be able to update the card simply by re-installing the newer version of the .apkg . However, this has the main caveat where if any of the fields are added, renamed, repositioned or deleted between card versions, this will not work (and instead add a new version of JP Mining Note , e.g. named JP Mining Note-b320fa ). Additionally, if you manually edited any of the fields, then this method will not work. To see if the fields have been changed, compare the first two numbers in the version you want to install to the first two numbers of the current card version. (TODO link FAQ) If the first two numbers match, then you are likely safe to manually update the card. If they don't match, then you MAY be able to get away with installing it anyways and transferring the old note types to the new note type. For example, a possible way to update the note is: Install the new version of the note. Select all the cards you want to transfer to the version, and change note type. Remove the old note type. Rename the new note type to the old note type name ( JP Mining Note ). See the changelog to see how the fields have changed and how you have to map the old fields to the new fields. Final Steps \u00b6 There may be further steps outside of just updating the card, such as updating Yomichan's templates / format. Further instructions on these are written below. Updating Yomichan's Anki Card Format \u00b6 To update the Yomichan Format, the steps should be almost the same as the one specified already in the setup . However, there are some differences that you should keep in mind. Refreshing the Fields \u00b6 The most important difference is that if a new field was added or a field has been renamed, then the field will not show up automatically in Yomichan . The only way to refresh the fields as of writing this (2022/09/06) is to change the Model at the top right hand corner to something else, and then switching back to JP Mining Note . Warning Doing the above WILL clear all the fields that you previously had, unless there is a matching field in that other card. Here is how I recommend transitioning as smoothly as possible: As always, create a backup of your Yomichan settings, just in case. After running install.py --update , create a temporary copy of the note by: Tools \u2192 Manage Note Types \u2192 Add \u2192 (select Clone: JP Mining Note ) \u2192 (name it to anything you want. For the following examples, it will be named JP Mining Note (copy) .) \u2192 Ok Head over to Anki Card Format as before . In the top right corner, change Model to JP Mining Note (copy) , and then change it back to JP Mining Note . Update the fields as specified. It will be both specified in the text you see when running install.py --update . However, you should also simply compare the table on the setup page to your filled out fields. Remove the temporary note: Tools \u2192 Manage Note Types \u2192 (select JP Mining Note (copy) ) \u2192 Delete Explanation Using the temporary copy of the updated card means that fields that remain unchanged between the old card and new card will be transferred automatically in the Yomichan Format. If you simply choose some random model like Basic , then almost none of the fields will be preserved, as the Basic card does not have any matching fields with the JP Mining Note model. Updating Yomichan Templates \u00b6 Like the above, you can simply follow the steps already specified in setup .

Definitions \u00b6 Binary Field: A field that checks whether it is filled or not with any value, say 1 . The default is implied by the name of the field, and a value of \"true\" means that the field is filled. For example, the IsSentenceCard field will turn the card into a sentence card if filled. If it is not filled, then the card will be a word card. To fill a field automatically, see here . To \"toggle\" a binary field means to either fill the value if is not filled yet, or to remove the value if it is filled. In other words, it means to flip the value of the field between empty and filled. PA: Short for \"Pitch Accent\". User Interface \u00b6 Most of the user interface is already shown off in the video demo in the README, and I would recommend watching it before continuing. However, to dispell any mysteries, here is a fully annotated summary of the user interface. Additional information on some parts of the UI is stated below: Info Circle \u00b6 On hover, the info circle on the top left corner just shows some basic info. TODO gif However, it serves as a sort of notification system to the user, when it has a color. Error \u00b6 TODO gif This should only appear when some javascript code fails. In other words, this should not appear normally. If you get this without modifying the note in any way, please report this as an issue! Warning \u00b6 TODO gif This serves to warn the user about something. It can appear without breaking the functionality of the card. In other words, you can choose to ignore it. Leech \u00b6 TODO gif When the card is a leech, the circle is highlighted yellow (only on the back side) to indicate that it is a leech. Kanji Hover \u00b6 Kanji hover shows you if you have seen the kanji in previous cards or not. By default, it searches for the kanji within the \"Word\" field, only for notes of the same type (JP Mining Note). To explain exactly how the results are being shown, the words are searched and moved into 3 categories: The two oldest, not new cards (already reviewed before, in order of add date) The two latest, not new cards (the most recent two cards that you have reviewed, in order of add date) The two oldest, new cards (the first 2 new cards that you will see with the kanji) The last category (the new cards) are greyed out to show that you haven't reviewed the card yet (i.e. you may not know the word yet). Conversely, the first two categories (the non-new cards) represent words that you likely already know, so they are not greyed out. Note The number of results per category can be changed in the options file . Results Sorting \u00b6 The above makes the assumption that you are reviewing in order of creation date, rather than the time of first review, to save resources. In other words, if you re-ordered your cards to be different from the add-date, then the kanji hover will not be able to recognize that. For people who review in order of frequency only, then the assumption above is completely broken. Unfortunately, there is currently no way to order the results by anything other than by the creation date. Suspended Cards \u00b6 Some assumptions are made about suspended cards. For example, suspended cards flagged as green are counted in the \"non-new\" cards category (known words), and suspended cards flagged as red are counted as words that you do not know AND will not study in the future (not shown in any category). This can be changed in the options file . Word Pitch \u00b6 The colors and what the lines mean are all described in the official anki addon page as specified here . Images \u00b6 TODO non bullet point click to zoom (the obvious feature) yomichan inserted images + user inserted images get changed to be similar to how yomichan displays images TODO gif Modifying the Front Side (Tested Content) \u00b6 The front side is exactly the content that we want to test ourselves on. Naturally, since we can test ourselves on many aspects of the word, there are many ways to change this tested content. Card types \u00b6 The default card type is a vocab card, where the tested content is simply the word. To change the card to a sentence card, toggle the IsSentenceCard binary field. There are many other card types that this note supports. To see the full list, see this section . Changing the Displayed Content \u00b6 Vocab cards show the Word field and sentence cards show the Sentence fields by default. However, you can modify what is exactly shown in the front by using the AltDisplay field. For example, the previous sentence card looks a little ugly, because the sentence splits off at a strange point. In the AltDisplay field, we add a newline at a sensible place (after the period) to get the following: Another example is shown below, when we want to only test the last sentence: One nice feature is that the AltDisplay has hoverable furigana text enabled by default. In other words, you can use furigana in the field. I personally use this to insert furigana for certain names, since I'm usually not testing myself on how to read a name. For example, the card below has the following HTML: \u4e0a\u6761[\u304b\u307f\u3058\u3087\u3046] \u606d\u4ecb[\u304d\u3087\u3046\u3059\u3051]\u541b\u306e\u3053\u3068\u304a < b > \u6155\u3044 </ b > \u3057\u3066\u307e\u3057\u305f\u306e Note If you are using a vocab card, you can use AltDisplay to show something that differs from the Word field. Note On Hybrid Card types, the AltDisplay field only affects the sentence, and not the front displayed word. Hints \u00b6 Finally, you can include a customized hint to show at the front of the card, by using the Hint field. This will show as a collapsible field at the front of card. If you do not want the hint to be hidden by default, you can use the HintNotHidden field instead. Modifying the Back Side \u00b6 Not much has to be said about modifying the back side of the card, outside of modifying pitch accent. The PrimaryDefinition field contains the main content, and should be the main field to edit if one wants to put down more notes about the card. I personally use this to write down grammar point explanations, sentence pitch accent info, etc. on top of the defintions. The AdditionalNotes field is useful if you want to put down even more notes, but keep it in a collapsible field to reduce vertical space. I personally use it to write down the context of the scene, and other notes that aren't completely crutial to understanding the tested content. Bolding anything in these sections will highlight the word in a light yellow tint, to make the bold stand out more. Modifying Pitch Accent \u00b6 TODO update primary field to edit is PAOverride takes in the inputs: number (position), or text: whatever you want it to show for most people, the number will suffice TODO gif Auto Selected Pitch Accent \u00b6 TODO details on exactly how the displayed pitch accent is displayed priority: PA Override number PA Override raw text PA Positions AJT Word Pitch if module disabled: only shows AJT Word Pitch reading: AJT word pitch by default can be changed to hiragana / katakana / katakana with long vowel marks ajt word pitch is katakana with long vowel marks (most of the time) some words don't have long vowel marks (i.e. adjectives ending with \u301c\u3057\u3044 will be displayed as \u301c\u30b7\u30a4 and not \u301c\u30b7\u30fc) Pitch Accent Styling Details \u00b6 TODO outdated TODO only if you care about the exact text value TODO what bold does Editing the content in WordPitch requires some special attention. To preserve the style and get expected results, you must use Ctrl + Shift + x when editing the field, and edit the html tags directly. Use other cards as examples of what the html should look like. TODO more details + example (\u83ef) TODO replace with positions :eyes: example of something that has all possible formats (bold, overline, downstep, nasal, devoiced) \u30c1\u30e5 < span style = \"text-decoration:overline;\" class = \"pitchoverline\" > \u30fc\u30ab < span class = \"nasal\" > \u00b0 </ span ></ span >< span class = \"downstep\" >< span class = \"downstep-inner\" > \ua71c </ span ></ span >< span class = \"nopron\" > \u30af </ span > \u30bb\u30a4 < b > \u30fb\u30c1\u30e5 < span style = \"text-decoration:overline;\" class = \"pitchoverline\" > \u30fc\u30ab < span class = \"nasal\" > \u00b0 </ span >< span class = \"nopron\" > \u30af </ span ></ span >< span class = \"downstep\" >< span class = \"downstep-inner\" > \ua71c </ span ></ span > \u30bb\u30a4 </ b > The WordPitch field may have more than one pitch accent for a given word. To choose which pitch accent is correct to the sentence, one can bold the unused pitch accents to grey them out. Modifying Other Aspects of the Card \u00b6 Key field \u00b6 This contains the tested word. In other words, this contains the exact same content as the field below, but this field is specifically not used in the card template. This is to allow the user to modify the key if duplicates arise, while still being able to test the word. For example, if I were to test different usages of \u4e0a, I can change this key value to \u4e0a (proposition) , \u4e0a (grammar) , etc. and add a new card. It is expected that this Key field is unique; a warning will appear on a card that has a duplicate key. Comment field \u00b6 Similarly to the Key field, this field will not be used in any card template. In other words, this is a place where you can write down notes without affecting the card itself. Testing Pitch Accent \u00b6 This note type provides many options to target exactly what parts of pitch accent you want to test yourself on. By default, pitch accent is not tested. To test for pitch accent, fill the PAShowInfo field. You should see a circle to the left of the word or sentence. TODO annotated image for testing pitch accent Pitch Accent Indicator \u00b6 This circle you see is called the \"Pitch Accent Indicator\", or \"PA Indicator\" for short. How this card indicates what pitch accent is tested is by the PA indicator's color. Here are what the colors represent: Green: The entire sentence is tested. Blue: Only the word is tested. Red: Pitch accent should not be tested in any way. If you ever forget what the colors mean, you can hover your mouse over the circle to get a description of what is being tested. Alternatively, you can look at the top right of the screen and look at the value after the / . Note If the tested content is a sentence (card), but you want to only test for word pitch accent, you would not be able to see the word normally. To see the word that is tested, there is a button to toggle whether the word is highlighted or not. The content that is highlighted is exactly what is bolded in the Sentence (or AltDisplay / AltDisplayPASentenceCard ) field, which is the added word by default. Selecting the Pitch Accent \u00b6 The following shows how to fill in the proper fields to test pitch accent: Filled fields PA Indicator Separated Cards (None, default) (Doesn't exist) PAShowInfo Green (sentence) or blue (word), depending on the tested content PAShowInfo & PADoNotTest Red (not tested) PAShowInfo & PATestOnlyWord Blue (word) PAShowInfo & PASeparateWordCard Red (not tested) Word PAShowInfo & PASeparateSentenceCard Blue (word) Sentence PAShowInfo & PASeparateWordCard & PASeparateSentenceCard Red (not tested) Word & Sentence To clarify some of the above: By default, if only PAShowInfo is filled, then the entire display is tested For vocab cards, targeted sentence cards, and hybrid vocab cards, only the word PA is tested (PA indicator: blue). For sentence cards and hybrid sentence, the entire sentence PA is tested (PA indicator: green). To test just the word pitch accent, fill the PATestOnlyWord field. To create completely separate cards to just test pitch accent on, use the fields PASeparateSentenceCard and/or PASeparateWordCard . If a PA word card is created, then the default card does not test pitch accent. Similarly, if a PA sentence card is created, then the default card only tests the word pitch accent. Modifying Pitch Accent Sentence Cards \u00b6 The field AltDisplayPASentenceCard exists to customize the display of the PA sentence card, if it exists. It works similarly to AltDisplay , and takes priority over AltDisplay in the PA sentence card. Runtime Options \u00b6 There are many options that can be set within the (javascript) runtime options file. To edit this, navigate to your profile's media folder ), and open the _jpmn-options.js file as a text file. TODO gif for windows (open as notepad) The contents of the file should look something like the following: var JPMNOpts = (function (my) { my.settings = { ... // a bunch of settings } return my; }(JPMNOpts || {})); I recommend going through this file and selecting the options that best fits your workflow. As each setting is already documented in the file, the settings will not be documented heavily here. Instead, a small number of hand selected settings will be showcased below, to give you a taste of what is available. TODO flesh out below Keybinds \u00b6 TODO gif with screenkey Modules \u00b6 Many javascript heavy code are separated into modules by default. These can be enabled and disabled at the user's will if the user wants to sacrifice functionality for a potentially faster card. Some examples include: kanji hover pitch accent selection. sentence processing image processing These modules likely also also have their own collection of settings to modify the behavior of said module. Colored Quotes instead of PA Indicator \u00b6 TODO picture comparisons between word PA indicator in quotes / word PA with PA indicator Greyed out fields \u00b6 TODO picture comparisons empty fields / empty fields but greyed out Open Extra Info \u00b6 TODO gif Cloze Deletion Cards \u00b6 Cloze deletion cards are simply a fancy way of saying \"fill-in-the-blank cards\". To test yourself, you simply check if you can hear the correct word in the missing sections. To create a cloze deletion card, simply fill in the SeparateClozeDeletionCard field. The words that are hidden are exactly the words that are bolded in the Sentence (or AltDisplay ) field.","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#definitions","text":"Binary Field: A field that checks whether it is filled or not with any value, say 1 .

If it is not filled, then the card will be a word card. To fill a field automatically, see here . To \"toggle\" a binary field means to either fill the value if is not filled yet, or to remove the value if it is filled.

    <!-- The above is a hack to allow a user to triple-click the definition
      without selecting everything below the line.
      This seems to ONLY affect the texthooker page;
      regular copy/pastes through everything I tried
      (pyperclip, text editor paste, pasting into Anki, etc)
      does not suffer from this problem.
      I figure that adding this shouldn't affect anything

# 132_anime_card
This is an example theme to showcase how a custom theme can be created and used.

This theme was inspired by 132#0792's
[modified version of JPMN](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1041466793094557879/1051496961531981834/Selected_Notes.apkg)
(v0.11.0.1).
This modified version of JPMN was based off of his own modified version of the
[Anime Card](https://animecards.site/).

## Limitations
- Certain parts of this theme will not scale properly with mobile.
- The tested content on the front-side is not shown on the back-side.
    Instead, the word is always shown.
    This is not a problem if you only use one card format.

> Short for "Optimized Vocab Card".

This is simply the default card type, with almost all of the javascript functionality
stripped from the template.
This is ideal for people who want a "lighter" card at the cost of various features.

One can easily change this to be an optimized (X) card, i.e. optimized sentence card,
by adjusting the `alwaysFilledFields` and `neverFilledFields` section.

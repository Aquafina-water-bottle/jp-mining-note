# A Brief History
From the very beginning of my exploration into Anki, I was a tiny bit baffled
that most the popular card types for studying Japanese seemed very "primitive".
Most of the time, it was extremely simple HTML, where the only difference between
each field was the size of the font.
As a result, the card itself was not very nice to look at and was very limited in functionality.
Some other cards went in a more interesting direction:
although the cards themselves actually looked pleasing, and it was clear that
there was plenty of work put into the styles,
they are usually too overstylized for my tastes,
and seemingly sacrified functionality and usability simply to be pleasing for the eye.

Given that as a starting point, I took one of the popular card types
and started building ontop of it.
Without a particular goal in mind,
whenever I saw something or thought of something that I thought would be nice to have in
a card, I added it.
This entire project is the result of continuously repeating that simple process.


# Why even use this card?
Previously, I used this page to attempt to sell the user into getting this card,
and attempted to list out the features that this card has to offer.
After some reflection, I've come to the conclusion that
it was not the best approach for this project, because after all,
this card will likely not change your life in any grandiose way.

At its core, this card is a stupidly simple card type,
just affixed with a large and ever growing collection of small quality of life features.

However, for me, these small things added up.

With each little addition, it has made my experience with Anki just a tiny bit better,
and after many, many of these little additions, I am happy to say that it has made Anki
much more enjoyable compared to my initial setup.


**I hope this note type is as useful for you as it is for me.**

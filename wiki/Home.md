# Motivation
In short, I could not find a note type that I liked all that much.
Most cards fell short in appearance, functionality, and ease-of-access features.
My hope was to change that, and create a note type that:
- Is intuitive to create and use,
- Has a simple but good looking design, and
- Able to test to arbitrary granularity, from a sentence to the vocab level, and everything in between.

This note type is the culmination of many hours of work, experimentation,
and ideas from many people.
I hope this note type will be as useful to you as it is for me.

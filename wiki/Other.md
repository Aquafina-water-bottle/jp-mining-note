### How to Mokuro
Note: I didn't write these guides at all, I just have it here to spam to anyone who's struggling the
setup process of mokuro

- [main mokuro page](https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro)
- [lazy guide](https://rentry.co/lazyXel#manga-with-yomichan)
    - (windows users) make sure to check the "add python to path" on install
    - make sure online processing (google colab) is
      [using the gpu](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/google_colab/google_colab_using_free_gpu.htm)
      to speed up the process

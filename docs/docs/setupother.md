# Separate Pitch Accent Deck
If you want card types to go to a different deck by default, you can change it by doing the following:

!!! example "Instructions"

    `Browse` (top middle) <br>
    →  `Cards...` (around the middle of the screen, right above first field of the note. This is NOT the `Cards` dropdown menu at the top right corner) <br>
    →  `Card Type` dropdown (top of the screen) <br>
    →  (choose pitch accent card type) <br>
    →  `Options` (the first `Options` you see at the very top of the screen) <br>
    →  `Deck Override...`

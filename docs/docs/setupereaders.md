# Summary

I do not own any eReader, so I cannot personally test or verify any of these methods.
However, there are a few ways of creating Anki Cards with various eReaders.

---

# Kindle

One can use something like [ann2html](https://github.com/xythh/ann2html)
to export a Yomichan-able HTML file based on the Kindle's vocabulary builder.
This allows you to add the cards through Yomichan on the PC.

# ONYX BOOX

ONYX BOOX internally uses Android.
You should be able to follow the steps under the [Android setup](setupextraandroid.md) page
in order to get this eReader working.

This section documents how to use the jp-mining-note handlebars on any template
that **is not jp-mining-note**.
If you are using jp-mining-note, please see the
[Reference: Definitions](definitions.md) and
[Reference: Yomichan Templates](yomichantemplates.md)
pages instead.

# Features

All of the features that comes with the standard jp-mining-note installation:

- A primary dictionary selector that automatically chooses the first bilingual or monolingual dictionary (depending on your settings)
- Automatic separation of auxillary dictionaries into monolingual and bilingual dictionaries
- Ability to manually select a dictionary or highlight a definition, to override the primary dictionary selector
- Option to hide the first line of monolingual dictionaries
- Options to minimize the html output, to get close-to-plaintext definitions
- Compatability with [most other handlebars](#compatability-with-other-handlebars)


# Setup
- general setup instructions (should be safe to link to setup instructions)


# Introduced Handlebars
- general info on the templates:
    - link to definitions page for more info (Dictionary Placement)
- general info on selecting the definition


# Compatability with other Handlebars
- compatability with other handlebars:
    - fully compatable SO LONG AS your other handlebars do not modify an existing function in place
    - everything is purposefully prefixed with `jpmn` (or `_jpmn`) to not interfere with other handlebars

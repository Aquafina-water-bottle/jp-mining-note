TODO is there a better way of laying out this info???


# Overview
This section is dedicated to explaining how to update JPMN,
as well as provide basic support for required steps outside of Anki.

TODO explain what exactly happens when updating?

- what it does:
    - replaces your template in place
        - removes any custom changes you made to your template!
        - please make a backup, link to FAQ
    - may add new fields, reposition fields, etc.
- what to expect:
    - for major updates (if any of the first two numbers in the version change),
        make sure to set aside some time to update, as it may take a while
        - may require updating things outside of Anki, such as Yomichan
    - other updates usually don't require much time (if the first two numbers remain the same):
        the user just needs to run the updating script

<!--
!!! warning

    Updating your card will **DELETE ANY CHANGES** you have made to the templates.

    Please make a [complete backup](faq.md#how-do-i-backup-my-anki-data)
    of your collection before continuing to update your note.

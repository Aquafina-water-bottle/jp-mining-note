- **Binary Field**:
    A field that checks whether it is filled or not with any value, say `1`.
    The default is implied by the name of the field, and a value of "true" means that the field is filled.
    For example, the `IsSentenceCard` field will turn the card into a sentence card if filled.
    If it is not filled, then the card will be a word card.
    To fill a field automatically, see

- **PA**: Short for "Pitch Accent".

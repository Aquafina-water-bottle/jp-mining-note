=== "Simple Definitions"
    Most monolingual dictionaries have extra info outside of the definition,
    and some people consider this distracting / unsightly.
    This note provides many ways on simplifying the definition by removing that info.

=== "Card Types"
    Choose between a multitude of available build-in card types:
    vocab cards, sentence cards, audio cards, or anything in between.

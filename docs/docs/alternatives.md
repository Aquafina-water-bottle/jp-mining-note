This page is dedicated to recording a (non-exhaustive) list of various note types,
that isn't [JPMN](/jp-mining-note/). These are added in order of when I first come across
the note type, so it's roughly ordered from the oldest to newest note types.

P.S. Feel free to let me know of any note types you find interesting
(including your own note type, or modified versions of this note),
and I will very likely add it here!
(Brownie points if you make a pull request for it too!)

??? quote "Description from the author"

    This is my anki card format it is based in the Gruvbox color scheme ({{ link("https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox") }}) and changes dynamically with your Anki theme, you will need this handlebars in yomichan for it to work: {{ link("https://pastebin.com/KSjbwrHk") }} (It is a modified version of the one in animecards, the only thing it changes is the color of the pitch pattern so it changes dynamically with the Anki theme) although if you're going to use the dark theme and you already have the animecards handlebars is not neccessary to download it although I still recommend it.

    You can change between vocab card, sentence card, vocab audio card, and sentence audio card.

??? quote "Description from the author"

    **UPDATE1: tango wasn't being colored in the sentence so i fixed it, check yomichan screen shot and add the css**
    **UPDATE2: added css**

    Here is my anki template, which is the result of bits I liked from other templates which I tried to glue together with my limited knowledge of programming.

    {{ link("https://streamable.com/j3etpw") }}

    Includes a card mined from the VN Steins;Gate 0 and a card from the LN 忘却探偵

    Yomichan: [https://i.imgur.com/vuHoVlM.png](https://i.imgur.com/vuHoVlM.png)

    Add this to the styling page of the template in anki

    - Handlebars: {{ link("https://pastebin.com/TeSJc6ij") }}

    **Features:**

    - Automatic pitch coloring from {{ link("https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1557722832") }} iirc
    - Semi-automatic title generation, so you know from which anime/VN etc. a word is from
    - drop down page for multiple definitions, that are automatically added
    - The same features as look below (you can reverse a word to be a sentence card, audio card etc, with one click)
    - has full coverage with the intergration of embedded websites (more on this in the next section)
    - NSFW filter to blur pictures from here https://rentry.co/mining
    - stroke order for vocab that can be activated if you do so (most of the time the stroke order is clear, but what i implemented it for, is for that 万が一 case where a word has a weird stroke order, making it easier to remember)
    - horrible and clusstered code made by me

    Note: This template is has following imperfections:

    1.  Idk how to insert a line break when a word has multiple readings, picture of the problem {{ link("https://i.imgur.com/YQpRgOj.png") }}
    2. Websites for more coverage are not displayed correct on mobile, also idk how to fix it 
    3. I think images are not responsively sized on mobile

    DM me if you have problems recreating the template (編集済)


    **CSS update:**

    Add this to the styling of the template in anki and check the yomichan screenshot above

    ```css
    .jpsentence {
        margin: 20px 0 0 0;
        font-size: 35px;
        text-align:center;
    }

    .pcolor {
    display: inline-block;
    }
    ```

    add this to .img2 and .img:
    ```css
    display:flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items:center;
    margin: 0 auto;
    ```

    add this exclusively to .img2:
    ```css
    margin-bottom: 25px;
    ```

    Remove on the front template the div with jpsentence for the tango

# jidoujisho's Note Type

The app [jidoujisho](https://github.com/lrorpilla/jidoujisho)
comes with its own Anki template, that should be automatically generated
on the first card add when using the app.

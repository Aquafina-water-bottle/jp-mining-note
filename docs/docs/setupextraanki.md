# Various Anki Resources
This documentation is primarily focused on how to use this note,
rather than Anki itself, so little will be written about the details of Anki here.

Instead, here is a small list of resources on setting up and using Anki itself:

* [Cade's blog: Optimizing Anki for Language Learning](https://cademcniven.com/posts/20210410/)
* [Tatsumoto's blog: Setting up Anki](https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/setting-up-anki.html)
* [Lazy Guide: Anki](https://rentry.co/lazyXel#anki)
    * Showcases an example note type, addons used and tips
* [Refold's Recommended Anki Setup](https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-1/a/anki-setup)
* [FSRS4Anki](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki)
* [Twenty Rules](https://www.supermemo.com/en/blog/twenty-rules-of-formulating-knowledge)
    * These are general rules for learning (with an SRS), written for SuperMemo. Some rules are not applicable for specifically language learning, but I believe the first 4 rules are very important.
* [Awesome Anki](https://github.com/tianshanghong/awesome-anki)
    * "A curated list of awesome Anki add-ons, decks and resources."

Note that every website here has different recommendations.
You will likely have to play with the settings and actually use Anki for an extended period of time
to find the most optimal setup for yourself.

# Other Anki Add-ons

I also provide a small list of other popular add-ons that I don't use, but may be useful for you.

# Made for Japanese Learning
The absolute fundamental goal of this note type is to **make learning Japanese easier**.
Every feature you see is to simply make this learning process easier and smoother.

# Minimalistic Design
This note is visually designed to be minimalistic because the fundamental goal is to learn Japanese,
not to have eye catching graphics.
The main focus is on the content, not the fluff.

# Minimal Dependencies
The only fundamental dependencies are `Yomichan` (to create the note) and the `Anki-Connect` add-on
(to export the note from `Yomichan`, update the note, and for certain features to work within the note).
Absolutely nothing else is required.
This helps with maintaining stability across various Anki versions.

# Modularized, Customizable & Extendable
This project ships with [built-in tools](runtimeoptions.md) to easily disable/enable features,
or even completely remove them from the base template via [compile options](compiletimeoptions.md).
Additionally, there are [many built-in ways](modding.md) to extend the note to suit your exact needs.

# Documentation First

and updated so you can use it to the best of your ability.

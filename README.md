**jp-mining-note** (JPMN) is an Anki card template for studying Japanese,
designed to be visually appealing and simple to use without sacrificing functionality.
Easily paired with most automatic card creation workflows,
this aims to make your experience with Anki as smooth as possible.

# Known Limitations
* No support for mobile. (Support for Ankidroid is planned for the future, but with no ETA.)
* No easy way to scale the card within the card itself.

# Main Features (Card Creation Workflow)
* All cards are **automatically created** and populated within seconds, with:
   * Definitions (with **automatic separation** of bilingual and monolingual definitions, using any combination of dictionaries)
   * Word pitch accent, audio, and frequency list information
   * The selected sentence with the tested word automatically highlighted
   * Automatically generated furigana on the selected sentence
   * (Optional) scene image and sentence audio

# Main Features (Card Features)
* Supports many card types, including:
   * The usual sentence & vocab cards,
   * [Targeted Sentence Cards](https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/discussing-various-card-templates.html#targeted-sentence-cards-or-mpvacious-cards),
     (see [here](https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jp-mining-note/wiki/CardTypes#targetted-sentence-card-tsc)),
   * [Anime Cards](https://animecards.site/ankicards/#anime-cardsword-context-cards)
     (see here (TODO link to FAQ)),
   * And [many more](https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jp-mining-note/wiki/CardTypes)!
* Support for **cloze-deletion** card types
* Support for **both monolingual and bilingual** definitions
* Support for various ways of **testing pitch accent**
   * Word level pitch accent
   * Sentence level pitch accent
   * Test the pitch accent in the same card or with different cards
   * Or don't test it at all!
* Various quality of life features, including but not limited to:
    * Customizable keyboard shortcuts for almost everything
    * Collapsible fields to hide non-crucial info (back-side)
    * Displays furigana (on mouse hover), frequency list information, and word pitch accent info
    * Click on any image to zoom in (in a similar style to Discord)
    * Error and warning messages for when things don't go as planned (info circle)

# Limitations
* No support for mobile. (Currently working on basic Ankidroid support!)
* No easy way to scale the card within the card itself.

# Setup & Usage
See the [wiki](https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jp-mining-note/wiki).

Note: The anki card package download is not publically available yet, as this is still WIP.
If you want the latest version to download, hit me up on Discord (Aquafina water bottle#3026).

# Other Info
Tested on Anki 2.1.53, Linux (Ubuntu) & Windows.
(It should work on any PC where Anki is supported.)

  * Use a consistent code style
  * Add more comments on style sheet
  * Use better variable names
* Add proper documentation:
  * Links to Anki documentation for specific vocab (i.e. notes vs cards)
  * What I test myself on for each type of card
  * Features
  * Fields
  * How to setup mandatory Anki plugins
  * How to setup Yomichan (templates and anki fields)
* Add sample cards

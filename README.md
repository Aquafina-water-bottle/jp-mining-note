# Main Features (Card Creation Workflow)
* All cards are **automatically created** and populated within seconds, with:
   * Definitions (with **automatic separation** of bilingual and monolingual definitions, using any combination of dictionaries)
   * Word pitch accent, audio, and frequency list information
   * The selected sentence with the tested word automatically highlighted
   * Automatically generated furigana on the selected sentence
   * (Optional, but highly recommended) scene image and sentence audio

# Main Features (Card Features)
* Supports **many card types**, including:
   * Sentence cards
   * Vocab cards (AKA [Anime Cards](https://animecards.site/ankicards/#anime-cardsword-context-cards))
   * [Targeted Sentence Cards](https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/discussing-various-card-templates.html#targeted-sentence-cards-or-mpvacious-cards)
   * Cloze deletion cards (sentence audio at the front)
* Support for **both monolingual and bilingual** definitions
* Support for various ways of testing pitch accent
* Various **quality of life** features, including but not limited to:
    * Kanji hover (hover over a kanji within the word reading to see if the kanji was used previously within other cards)
    * Customizable keyboard shortcuts for almost everything
    * Collapsible fields to hide non-crucial info
    * Zoomable images on click
    * Built in logging system to display warnings / errors

# Limitations
* No support for mobile. <!--(Currently working on basic Ankidroid support!)-->
* No easy way to scale the card within the card itself.

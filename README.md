Working on documentation, fleshing out details, providing example cards, etc.

## Main Features
* All cards are **automatically created** and populated within seconds
* Supports **both sentence and vocab** cards
* Support for **both monolingual and bilingual** definitions,
   including **automatic separation** of bilingual and monolingual definitions
* Support for **cloze-deletion** card types
* Support for various ways of **testing pitch accent**
   * Word level pitch accent
   * Sentence level pitch accent
   * Test the pitch accent in the same card or with different cards

* See customization section (TODO link) for further points


## TODO:
* Clean up the codebase (almost done!)
  * Use a consistent code style

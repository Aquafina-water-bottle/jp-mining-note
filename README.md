TODO gif showing the main features of the card type
-->

## Main Features (Card Creation Workflow)
* All cards are **automatically created** and populated within seconds, with:
   * Definitions (with **automatic separation** of bilingual and monolingual definitions, using any combination of dictionaries)
   * Word pitch accent, audio, and frequency list information
   * The selected sentence with the tested word automatically highlighted
   * Automatically generated furigana on the selected sentence
   * (Optional) scene image and sentence audio

## Main Features (Card Features)
* Supports **both sentence and vocab** cards, as well as
  [many alternative card types](https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jp-mining-note/wiki/CardTypes).
* Support for **cloze-deletion** card types
* Support for **both monolingual and bilingual** definitions
* Support for various ways of **testing pitch accent**
   * Word level pitch accent
   * Sentence level pitch accent
   * Test the pitch accent in the same card or with different cards
   * Or don't test it at all!
* Optional hint (front-side)
* Various quality of life features:
    * Collapsible fields to hide non-crucial info (back-side)
    * Displays furigana (on mouse hover), frequency list information, and word pitch accent info
    * Click on any image to zoom in (in a similar style to Discord)

## Limitations
* No support for mobile.
* Stylization is for my personal anki theme (default dark mode) and screen resolution (1920x1080).
  This will likely not have good HiDPI support.

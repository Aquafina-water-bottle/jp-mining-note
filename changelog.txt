Notes on versioning:
- The last 3 numbers (# in X.#.#.#) follow basic semantic versioning.
The 2nd number is bumped when any BREAKING changes occur (field rename, field
addition, field deletion).
- The first number (X in X.#.#.#) is an arbitrary number that I decide for
when the card passes a specific stage (i.e. 0 == pre-release, 1 = release, and
subsequent bumps are when the card has changed enough that a bump should be
signified.)

0.0.1.0
- First official "version" attached to the card

0.0.1.1
- (WIP) Adding various support for mobile anki styles. PC styles should not be
affected.

0.1.0.0
- (BREAKING) renamed "ForceHighlightSentence" -> "IsTargetedSentenceCard"
- changed the functionality of `ForceHighlightSentence` to be its own
individual `IsTargetedSentenceCard` (filling `IsSentenceCard` is now optional,
click and hover cards still use the field to create the (now renamed) click
TSCs and hover TSCs.
- fixed having the "show" button on TSCs
- Changed the versioning system from normal semantic versioning to X.(semantic
versioning)


0.1.1.0
- Added keybind functionality to the main card type for playing sentence
audio, toggling pitch accent word in a sentence card & toggling hybrid cards

- fixed the shift button not always working

`IsSentenceCard` field is not filled, on click / hover cards

goal of this script:
    - prevent having the user to manually update their anki card each time
    - automatically update yomichan-generated html when yomichan templates are updated
    - ease the process of converting their existing cards into this with bulk additions


TODO:
- bulk add
    - i.e. PASilence -> [silence.wav]

- sanitize
    - PASilence
    - provide options to auto-filling fields

- field modifications:
    - rename
    - reposition
    - deleting / adding
    - (stretch goal) description


- detection of version
    - way of specifying what to do for each major version bump
